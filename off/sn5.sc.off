^ck#s45(Path)^cksn#s45a(1. Ignorance )Ignorance ^bk#sn5^n1 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, ignorance precedes the attainment of unskillful qualities, with lack of conscience and prudence following along. 
An ignoramus, sunk in ignorance, gives rise to wrong view. 
Wrong view gives rise to wrong thought. 
Wrong thought gives rise to wrong speech. 
Wrong speech gives rise to wrong action. 
Wrong action gives rise to wrong livelihood. 
Wrong livelihood gives rise to wrong effort. 
Wrong effort gives rise to wrong mindfulness. 
Wrong mindfulness gives rise to wrong immersion. 
Knowledge precedes the attainment of skillful qualities, with conscience and prudence following along. 
A sage, firm in knowledge, gives rise to right view. 
Right view gives rise to right thought. 
Right thought gives rise to right speech. 
Right speech gives rise to right action. 
Right action gives rise to right livelihood. 
Right livelihood gives rise to right effort. 
Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness. 
Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion.” 

1. Ignorance )Half the Spiritual Life ^n2 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Townsville. 
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, good friends, companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.” 
“Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! 
Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life. 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path. 
And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? 
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. 
They develop right thought … 
right speech … 
right action … 
right livelihood … 
right effort … 
right mindfulness … 
right immersion, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. 
That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. 
And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life. 
For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things. 
This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.” 

1. Ignorance )Sāriputta ^n3 At Sāvatthī. 
Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life. 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path. 
And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? 
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. 
And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life. 
For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things. 
This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.” 

1. Ignorance )Regarding the Brahmin Jāṇussoṇi ^n4 At Sāvatthī. 
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
He saw the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi driving out of Sāvatthī in a splendid all-white chariot drawn by mares. 
The yoked horses were pure white, as were the ornaments, chariot, upholstery, reins, goad, and canopy. And his turban, robes, sandals were white, as was the chowry fanning him. 
When people saw it they exclaimed, 
“Wow! That’s a Brahmā vehicle! 
It’s a vehicle fit for Brahmā!” 
Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding, 






“Sir, can you point out a Brahmā vehicle in this teaching and training?” 
“I can, Ānanda,” said the Buddha. 
“These are all terms for the noble eightfold path: 
‘vehicle of Brahmā’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’. 
When right view is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion. 
When right thought … 
right speech … 
right action … 
right livelihood … 
right effort … 
right mindfulness … 
right immersion is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion. 
This is a way to understand how these are all terms for the noble eightfold path: 
‘vehicle of Brahmā’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“Its qualities of faith and wisdom 
are always yoked to the shaft. 
Conscience is its pole, mind its strap, 
and mindfulness its careful driver. 
The chariot’s equipped with ethics, 
its axle is absorption, and energy its wheel. 
Equanimity and immersion are the carriage-shaft, 
and it’s upholstered with desirelessness. 
Good will, harmlessness, and seclusion 
are its weapons, 
patience its shield and armor, 
as it rolls on to sanctuary. 
This supreme Brahmā vehicle 
arises in oneself. 
The wise leave the world in it, 
sure of winning the victory.” 

1. Ignorance )What’s the Purpose ^n5 At Sāvatthī. 
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha … and said to him: 
“Sir, sometimes wanderers of other religions ask us: 
‘Reverends, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?’ 
We answer them like this: 
‘The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha is to completely understand suffering.’ 
Answering this way, we trust that we repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. We trust our explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.” 
“Indeed, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism. 
For the purpose of leading the spiritual life under me is to completely understand suffering. 
If wanderers of other religions were to ask you: 
‘Is there a path and a practice for completely understanding that suffering?’ You should answer them like this: 
‘There is.’ 
And what is that path? 
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
This is the path and the practice for completely understanding suffering. 
When questioned by wanderers of other religions, that’s how you should answer them.” 

1. Ignorance )A Mendicant (1st) ^n6 At Sāvatthī. 
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and asked him, 
“Sir, they speak of this thing called the ‘spiritual path’. 
What is the spiritual path? And what is the culmination of the spiritual path?” 
“Mendicant, the spiritual path is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
The ending of greed, hate, and delusion. 
This is the culmination of the spiritual path.” 

1. Ignorance )A Mendicant (2nd) ^n7 At Sāvatthī. 
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and said to him: 
“Sir, they speak of ‘the removal of greed, hate, and delusion’. 
What is this a term for?” 

“Mendicant, the removal of greed, hate, and delusion is a term for the element of extinguishment. 

It’s used to speak of the ending of defilements.” 
When he said this, the mendicant said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, they speak of ‘the deathless’. 
What is the deathless? And what is the path that leads to the deathless?” 
“The ending of greed, hate, and delusion. 
This is called the deathless. 
The path that leads to the deathless is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.” 

1. Ignorance )Analysis ^n8 At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, I will teach and analyze for you the noble eightfold path. 
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“And what is the noble eightfold path? 
It is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
And what is right view? 
Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
This is called right view. 
And what is right thought? 
It is the thought of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. 
This is called right thought. 
And what is right speech? 
Avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. 
This is called right speech. 
And what is right action? 
Avoiding killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual activity. 
This is called right action. 
And what is right livelihood? 
It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood. 
This is called right livelihood. 
And what is right effort? 
It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. 
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. 
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have not arisen do arise. 
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development. 
This is called right effort. 
And what is right mindfulness? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
This is called right mindfulness. 
And what is right immersion? 
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
This is called right immersion.” 

1. Ignorance )A Spike ^n9 At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the wrong way. If you trod on it with hand or foot, there’s no way it could break the skin and produce blood. 
Why is that? 
Because the spike is pointing the wrong way. 
In the same way, a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the wrong way cannot break ignorance, produce knowledge, and realize extinguishment. 
Why is that? 
Because their view is pointing the wrong way. 
Suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the right way. If you trod on it with hand or foot, it may well break the skin and produce blood. 
Why is that? 
Because the spike is pointing the right way. 
In the same way, a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the right way may well break ignorance, produce knowledge, and realize extinguishment. 
Why is that? 
Because their view is pointing the right way. 
And how does a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the right way break ignorance, give rise to knowledge, and realize extinguishment? 
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
That’s how a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the right way breaks ignorance, gives rise to knowledge, and realizes extinguishment.” 

1. Ignorance )With Nandiya ^n10 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the wanderer Nandiya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, how many things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end?” 
“These eight things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end. 
What eight? 
They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
These eight things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end.” 
When he said this, the wanderer Nandiya said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 







^cksn#s45b(2. Meditation )Meditation (1st) ^n11 At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for a fortnight. 
No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. 
Then after a fortnight had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, I’ve been practicing part of the meditation I practiced when I was first awakened. 
I understand that 
there’s feeling conditioned by wrong view 
and feeling conditioned by right view. … 
There’s feeling conditioned by wrong immersion, 
and feeling conditioned by right immersion. 
There’s feeling conditioned by desire, 
by thought, 
and by perception. 
As long as desire, thought, and perception are not stilled, there is feeling conditioned by that. 
When desire, thought, and perception are stilled, there is feeling conditioned by that. 
There is effort to attain the unattained. When that state has been attained, there is also feeling conditioned by that.”

Then after three months had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, I’ve been practicing part of the meditation I practiced when I was first awakened. 
I understand that 
there’s feeling conditioned by wrong view 
and by the stilling of wrong view, 
by right view 
and by the stilling of right view. … 
There’s feeling conditioned by wrong immersion 
and by the stilling of wrong immersion, by right immersion 
and by the stilling of right immersion. 
There’s feeling conditioned by desire 
and by the stilling of desire, 
by thought 
and by the stilling of thought, 
by perception 
and by the stilling of perception. 
As long as desire, thought, and perception are not stilled, there is feeling conditioned by that. 
When desire, thought, and perception are stilled, there is feeling conditioned by that. 
There is effort to attain the unattained. When that state has been attained, there is also feeling conditioned by that.” 

2. Meditation )A Trainee ^n13 At Sāvatthī. 
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and asked him,

That’s how a trainee is defined.”

Someone who possesses this noble eightfold path 
is called someone on the spiritual path.

this is the culmination of the spiritual path.”

1. Mountains )Ethics ^n184 “Mendicants, when a mendicant is accomplished in ethics, immersion, knowledge, freedom, or the knowledge and vision of freedom, even the sight of them is very helpful, I say. 
Even to hear them, 
approach them, 
pay homage to them, 
recollect them, 
or go forth following them is very helpful, I say. 
Why is that? 
Because after hearing the teaching of such mendicants, a mendicant will live withdrawn in both body and mind, 
as they recollect and think about that teaching. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; 
they develop it 
and perfect it. 
As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that teaching with wisdom. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; 
they develop it 
and perfect it. 
As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it. 
When they’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it. 
When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it. 
When the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it. 
They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. 
When the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this way they can expect seven fruits and benefits. 
What seven? 
They attain enlightenment early on in this very life. 
If not, they attain enlightenment at the time of death. 
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters, they’re extinguished between one life and the next. 
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished upon landing. 
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished without extra effort. 
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished with extra effort. 
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to the Akaniṭṭha realm. 
When the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this way these are the seven fruits and benefits they can expect.” 

1. Mountains )Clothes ^n185 At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, mendicants!” 
“Reverend,” they replied. 
Sāriputta said this: 
“There are these seven awakening factors. 
What seven? 
The awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. 
These are the seven awakening factors. 
In the morning, I meditate on whichever of these seven awakening factors I want. 
At midday, 
and in the evening, I meditate on whichever of these seven awakening factors I want. 
If it’s the awakening factor of mindfulness, I know that it’s limitless and that it’s properly implemented. While it remains I understand that it remains. 
And if it subsides in me I understand the specific reason it subsides. … 
If it’s the awakening factor of equanimity, I know that it’s limitless and that it’s properly implemented. While it remains I understand that it remains. 
And if it subsides I understand the specific reason it subsides. 
Suppose that a ruler or their minister had a chest full of garments of different colors. 
In the morning, they’d don whatever pair of garments they wanted. 
At midday, 
and in the evening, they’d don whatever pair of garments they wanted. 
In the same way, in the morning, 
at midday, 
and in the evening, I meditate on whichever of these seven awakening factors I want. 
If it’s the awakening factor of mindfulness, I know that it’s limitless and that it’s properly implemented. While it remains I understand that it remains.

If it’s the awakening factor of equanimity, I know that it’s limitless and that it’s properly implemented. While it remains I understand that it remains. 
And if it subsides I understand the specific reason it subsides.” 

1. Mountains )A Monk ^n186 At Sāvatthī. 
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and asked him, 
“Sir, they speak of the ‘awakening factors’. 
How are the awakening factors defined?” 
“Mendicant, they’re called awakening factors because they lead to awakening. 
A mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
As they develop the seven awakening factors, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. 
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
They’re called awakening factors because they lead to awakening.” 

1. Mountains )Kuṇḍaliya ^n187 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer park at the Añjana Wood. 
Then the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, I like to hang around the monasteries and visit the assemblies. 
When I’ve finished breakfast, it’s my habit to 
wander from monastery to monastery, from park to park. 
There I see some ascetics and brahmins speaking for the sake of winning debates and finding fault. 
But what benefit does Master Gotama live for?” 
“The benefit the Realized One lives for, Kuṇḍaliya, is the fruit of knowledge and freedom.” 
“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill knowledge and freedom?” 
“The seven awakening factors.” 
“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the seven awakening factors?” 
“The four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” 
“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?” 
“The three kinds of good conduct.” 
“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct?” 
“Sense restraint. 
And Kuṇḍaliya, how is sense restraint developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct? 
A mendicant sees an agreeable sight with their eye. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed. 
Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. 
But if they see a disagreeable sight they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will. 
Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. 
Furthermore, a mendicant hears an agreeable sound with the ear … 
smells an agreeable odor with the nose … 
tastes an agreeable flavor with the tongue … 
feels an agreeable touch with the body … 
knows an agreeable thought with their mind. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed. 
Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. 
But if they know a disagreeable thought they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will. 
Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. 
When a mendicant’s mind and body are steady internally, they’re well settled and well freed when it comes to both agreeable and disagreeable sights, 
sounds, 
smells, 
tastes, 
touches, 
and thoughts. 
That’s how sense restraint is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct. 
And how are the three kinds of good conduct developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? 
A mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develops good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. 
That’s how the three kinds of good conduct are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors? 
A mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors. 
And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom? 
A mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” 
When he said this, the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

1. Mountains )A Bungalow ^n188 “Mendicants, the rafters of a bungalow all slant, slope, and incline to the peak. 
In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment. 
And how does a mendicant who develops the seven awakening factors slant, slope, and incline to extinguishment? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
That’s how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.”

Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Upavāna and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Upavāna: 
“Reverend Upavāna, can a mendicant know by investigating inside themselves that the seven awakening factors are well implemented so that they lead to living at ease?” 
“They can, Reverend Sāriputta. 
As a mendicant rouses up the awakening factor of mindfulness, they understand: ‘My mind is well freed. I’ve eradicated dullness and drowsiness, and eliminated restlessness and remorse. My energy is roused up, and my mind is sharply focused, not sluggish.’ … 
As they rouse up the awakening factor of equanimity, they understand: ‘My mind is well freed. I’ve eradicated dullness and drowsiness, and eliminated restlessness and remorse. My energy is roused up, and my mind is sharply focused, not sluggish.’

This is where these fetters, shackles, and attachments arise. 
The ear … nose … tongue … body … 

mind is something that’s prone to being fettered. 
This is where these fetters, shackles, and attachments arise. 
These are called the things that are prone to being fettered.” 

3. With Udāyī )With Udāyī ^n211 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. 
Then Venerable Udāyī went up to the Buddha … and said to him: 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
How helpful my love and respect for the Buddha have been, and my sense of conscience and prudence. 
For when I was still a layman, I wasn’t helped much by the teaching or the Saṅgha. 
But when I considered my love and respect for the Buddha, and my sense of conscience and prudence, I went forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
The Buddha taught me the Dhamma: 
‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. 
Such is feeling … 
Such is perception … 
Such are choices … 
Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 
Then, while staying in an empty hut, I followed the churning of the five grasping aggregates. I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
I comprehended the teaching; I acquired the path. 
When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: 
‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
I acquired the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. 

When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, they will bring me to such a state that I will understand: 
‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
This is the path that I acquired. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: 
‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” 
“Good, good, Udāyī! 
For that is indeed the path that you acquired. When developed and cultivated as you’re living in such a way, it will bring you to such a state that you will understand: 
‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
That’s how a diligent mendicant develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors.”

The peepal, banyan, wavy leaf fig, cluster fig, Moreton Bay fig, and portia. 
These are the large trees with tiny seeds and big trunks, which grow up and around other trees as parasites. The trees they engulf break apart, collapse, and fall.

6. Discussion )Is There a Way? ^n233 Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
Then it occurred to him, 
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. 
Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” 
Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: 
“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: 
‘Mendicants, please give up the five hindrances—corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom—and truly develop the seven awakening factors.’ 
We too teach our disciples: 
‘Reverends, please give up the five hindrances—corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom—and truly develop the seven awakening factors.’ 
What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” 
Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions. 
They got up from their seat, thinking: 
“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” 
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 












“Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say to them: 
‘But reverends, is there a way in which the five hindrances become ten and the seven awakening factors become fourteen?’ 
Questioned like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. 
Why is that? 
Because they’re out of their element. 
I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. 
And what is the way in which the five hindrances become ten? 
Sensual desire for what is internal is a hindrance; and sensual desire for what is external is also a hindrance. 
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of sensual desire’ becomes twofold. 
Ill will for what is internal is a hindrance; and ill will for what is external is also a hindrance. 
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of ill will’ becomes twofold. 
Dullness is a hindrance; and drowsiness is also a hindrance. 
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness’ becomes twofold. 
Restlessness is a hindrance; and remorse is also a hindrance. 
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of restlessness and remorse’ becomes twofold. 
Doubt about internal things is a hindrance; and doubt about external things is also a hindrance. 
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of doubt’ becomes twofold. 
This is the way in which the five hindrances become ten. 
And what is the way in which the seven awakening factors become fourteen? 
Mindfulness of internal things is the awakening factor of mindfulness; and mindfulness of external things is also the awakening factor of mindfulness. 
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of mindfulness’ becomes twofold. 
Investigating, exploring, and inquiring into internal things with wisdom is the awakening factor of investigation of principles; and investigating, exploring, and inquiring into external things with wisdom is also the awakening factor of investigation of principles. 
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of investigation of principles’ becomes twofold. 
Physical energy is the awakening factor of energy; and mental energy is also the awakening factor of energy. 
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of energy’ becomes twofold. 
Rapture while placing the mind and keeping it connected is the awakening factor of rapture; and rapture without placing the mind and keeping it connected is also the awakening factor of rapture. 
In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of rapture’ becomes twofold. 
Physical tranquility is the awakening factor of tranquility; and mental tranquility is also the awakening factor of tranquility. 
In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of tranquility’ becomes twofold. 
Immersion while placing the mind and keeping it connected is the awakening factor of immersion; and immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected is also the awakening factor of immersion. 
In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of immersion’ becomes twofold. 
Equanimity for internal things is the awakening factor of equanimity; and equanimity for external things is also the awakening factor of equanimity. 
In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of equanimity’ becomes twofold. 
This is the way in which the seven awakening factors become fourteen.” 

6. Discussion )Fire ^n234 Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
(The same as the previous discourse.) 
“Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say to them: 
‘Reverends, which awakening factors should not be developed when the mind is sluggish? And which awakening factors should be developed at that time? 
Which awakening factors should not be developed when the mind is restless? And which awakening factors should be developed at that time?’ 
Questioned like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. 
Why is that? 
Because they’re out of their element.

When the mind is sluggish, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. 
Why is that? 
Because it’s hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. 
Suppose someone wanted to make a small fire flare up. 
If they toss wet grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, spray it with water, and scatter dirt on it, 
could they make it flare up?” 
“No, sir.” 
“In the same way, when the mind is sluggish, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. 
Why is that? 
Because it’s hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. 
When the mind is sluggish, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. 
Why is that? 
Because it’s easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. 
Suppose someone wanted to make a small fire flare up. 
If they toss dry grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, blow on it, and don’t scatter dirt on it, 
could they make it flare up?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“In the same way, when the mind is sluggish, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. 
Why is that? 
Because it’s easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. 
When the mind is restless, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. 
Why is that? 
Because it’s hard to settle a restless mind with these things. 
Suppose someone wanted to extinguish a bonfire. 
If they toss dry grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, blow on it, and don’t scatter dirt on it, 
could they extinguish it?” 
“No, sir.” 
“In the same way, when the mind is restless, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture.

But mindfulness is always useful, I say.” 

6. Discussion )Full of Love ^n235 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town called Haliddavasana. 
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Haliddavasana for alms. 
Then it occurred to them, 
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Haliddavasana. 
Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” 
Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: 
“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: 
‘Come, mendicants, give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom, and meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’ 
We too teach our disciples in just the same way. 





What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” 
Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions. 
They got up from their seat, thinking: 
“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” 
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 



















“Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say to them: 
‘But reverends, how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and culmination? 
How is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? 
How is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? 
How is the heart’s release by equanimity developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?’ 
Questioned like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. 
Why is that? 
Because they’re out of their element. 
I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. 
And how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by love together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
The apex of the heart’s release by love is the beautiful, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. 
And how is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by compassion together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. … 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
Or else, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. 
The apex of the heart’s release by compassion is the dimension of infinite space, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. 
And how is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by rejoicing together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. … 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
Or else, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. 
The apex of the heart’s release by rejoicing is the dimension of infinite consciousness, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. 
And how is the heart’s release by equanimity developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by equanimity together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.

If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
Or else, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. 
The apex of the heart’s release by equanimity is the dimension of nothingness, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom.” 

6. Discussion )With Saṅgārava ^n236 At Sāvatthī. 
Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why sometimes even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced? 
And why is it that sometimes even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced?” 
“Brahmin, there’s a time when your heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire and you don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. At that time you don’t truly know or see what is good for yourself, good for another, or good for both. Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. 
Suppose there was a bowl of water that was mixed with dye such as red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder. 
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it.

These seven awakening factors are not obstacles, hindrances, or corruptions of the mind. When developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of knowledge and freedom. 
What seven? 
The awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. 
These seven awakening factors are not obstacles, hindrances, or corruptions of the mind. When developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of knowledge and freedom.” 
When he said this, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

6. Discussion )With Prince Abhaya ^n237 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
Then Prince Abhaya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa says this: 
‘There is no cause or reason for not knowing and not seeing. 
Not knowing and not seeing have no cause or reason. 
There is no cause or reason for knowing and seeing. 
Knowing and seeing have no cause or reason.’ 
What does the Buddha say about this?” 
“Prince, there are causes and reasons for not knowing and not seeing. 
Not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons. 
There are causes and reasons for knowing and seeing. 
Knowing and seeing have causes and reasons.” 
“But sir, what is the cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing? 
How do not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons?” 
“There’s a time when the heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, without truly knowing and seeing the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. 
This is a cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing. 
And this is how not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons. 
Furthermore, there’s a time when the heart is overcome and mired in ill will … 
dullness and drowsiness … 
restlessness and remorse … 
doubt, without truly knowing and seeing the escape from doubt that has arisen. 
This is a cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing. 
And this is how not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons.” 
“Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” 
“These are called the ‘hindrances’, prince.” 
“Indeed, Blessed One, these are hindrances! 
Indeed, Holy One, these are hindrances! 
Overcome by even a single hindrance you wouldn’t truly know or see, let alone all five hindrances. 
But sir, what is the cause and reason for knowing and seeing? 
How do knowing and seeing have causes and reasons?” 
“It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. 
They truly know and see with a mind that has developed the awakening factor of mindfulness. 
This is a cause and reason for knowing and seeing. 
And this is how knowing and seeing have causes and reasons. 
Furthermore, a mendicant develops the awakening factor of investigation of principles … energy … rapture … tranquility … immersion … 
equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
They truly know and see with a mind that has developed the awakening factor of equanimity. 
This is a cause and reason for knowing and seeing. 
And this is how knowing and seeing have causes and reasons.” 
“Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” 
“These are called the ‘awakening factors’, prince.” 
“Indeed, Blessed One, these are awakening factors! 
Indeed, Holy One, these are awakening factors! 
Endowed with even a single awakening factor you would truly know and see, let alone all seven awakening factors. 
When climbing Mount Vulture’s Peak I became fatigued in body and mind. But this has now faded away. And I’ve comprehended the teaching.”

^ck#s47(Mindfulness Meditation)^cksn#s47a(1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove ^n367 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s Mango Grove. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. 
What four? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )Mindful ^n368 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s mango grove. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, a mendicant should live mindful and aware. 
This is my instruction to you. 
And how is a mendicant mindful? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
That’s how a mendicant is mindful. 
And how is a mendicant aware? 
It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. 
That’s how a mendicant acts with situational awareness. 
A mendicant should live mindful and aware. 
This is my instruction to you.” 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )A Monk ^n369 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 
“This is exactly how some foolish people ask me for something. But when the teaching has been explained they think only of following me around.” 
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!” 
“Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. 
What is the starting point of skillful qualities? 
Well purified ethics and correct view. 
When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics. 
What four? 
Meditate observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or meditate observing an aspect of the body externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or meditate observing an aspect of the body internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally … 
externally … 
internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally … 
externally … 
internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or meditate observing an aspect of principles internally … 
externally … 
internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
When you develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in these three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.” 
And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And that mendicant became one of the perfected. 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )At Sālā ^n370 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near the brahmin village of Sālā. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, those mendicants who are junior—recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training—should be encouraged, supported, and established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
What four? 
Please, reverends, meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know the body. 
Meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know feelings. 
Meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know the mind. 
Meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know principles. 
Those mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary—also meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to fully understand the body. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to fully understand feelings. 
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to fully understand the mind. 
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to fully understand principles. 
Those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—also meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, detached from the body. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, detached from feelings. 
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, detached from the mind. 
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, detached from principles. 
Those mendicants who are junior—recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training—should be encouraged, supported, and established in these four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )A Heap of the Unskillful ^n371 At Sāvatthī. 
There the Buddha said: 
“Rightly speaking, mendicants, you’d call these five hindrances a ‘heap of the unskillful’. 
For these five hindrances are entirely a heap of the unskillful. 
What five? 
The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. 
Rightly speaking, you’d call these five hindrances a ‘heap of the unskillful’. 
For these five hindrances are entirely a heap of the unskillful. 
Rightly speaking, you’d call these four kinds of mindfulness meditation a ‘heap of the skillful’. 
For these four kinds of mindfulness meditation are entirely a heap of the skillful. 
What four? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind … 
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Rightly speaking, you’d call these four kinds of mindfulness meditation a ‘heap of the skillful’. 
For these four kinds of mindfulness meditation are entirely a heap of the skillful.” 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )A Hawk ^n372 “Once upon a time, mendicants, a hawk suddenly swooped down and grabbed a quail. 
And as the quail was being carried off he wailed, 
‘I’m so unlucky, so unfortunate, to have roamed out of my territory into the domain of others. 
If today I’d roamed within my own territory, the domain of my fathers, this hawk wouldn’t have been able to beat me by fighting.’ 
‘So, quail, what is your own territory, the domain of your fathers?’ 
‘It’s a ploughed field covered with clods of earth.’ 
Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She released the quail, saying, 
‘Go now, quail. But even there you won’t escape me!’ 
Then the quail went to a ploughed field covered with clods of earth. He climbed up a big clod, and standing there, he said to the hawk: 
‘Come get me, hawk! Come get me, hawk!’ 
Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She folded her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail. 
When the quail knew that the hawk was nearly there, he slipped under that clod. 
But the hawk crashed chest-first right there. 
That’s what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others. 
So, mendicants, don’t roam out of your own territory into the domain of others. 
If you roam out of your own territory into the domain of others, Māra will find a vulnerability and get hold of you. 
And what is not a mendicant’s own territory but the domain of others? 
It’s the five kinds of sensual stimulation. 
What five? 
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
Sounds known by the ear … 
Smells known by the nose … 
Tastes known by the tongue … 
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
This is not a mendicant’s own territory but the domain of others. 
You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. 
If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t find a vulnerability or get hold of you. 
And what is a mendicant’s own territory, the domain of the fathers? 

It’s the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
What four? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
This is a mendicant’s own territory, the domain of the fathers.” 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )A Monkey ^n373 “Mendicants, in the Himalayas there are regions that are rugged and impassable. In some such regions, neither monkeys nor humans can go, 
while in others, monkeys can go but not humans. 
There are also level, pleasant places where both monkeys and humans can go. 
There hunters lay snares of tar on the monkey trails to catch the monkeys. 
The monkeys who are not foolhardy and reckless see the tar and avoid it from afar. 
But a foolish and reckless monkey goes up to the tar and grabs it with a hand. 
He gets stuck there. 
Thinking to free his hand, he grabs it with his other hand. 
He gets stuck there. 
Thinking to free both hands, he grabs it with a foot. 
He gets stuck there. 
Thinking to free both hands and foot, he grabs it with his other foot. 
He gets stuck there. 
Thinking to free both hands and feet, he grabs it with his snout. 
He gets stuck there. 
And so the monkey, trapped at five points, just lies there screeching. He’d meet with tragedy and disaster, and the hunter can do what he wants with him. 
The hunter spears him, pries him off that tarred block of wood, and goes wherever he wants. 
That’s what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others. 
So, mendicants, don’t roam out of your own territory into the domain of others. 
If you roam out of your own territory into the domain of others, Māra will find a vulnerability and get hold of you. 
And what is not a mendicant’s own territory but the domain of others? 

It’s the five kinds of sensual stimulation. 
What five? 
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.

Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
This is not a mendicant’s own territory but the domain of others. 
You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. 
If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t find a vulnerability or get hold of you. 
And what is a mendicant’s own territory, the domain of the fathers? 

It’s the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
What four? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
This is a mendicant’s own territory, the domain of the fathers.” 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )Cooks ^n374 “Mendicants, suppose a foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook was to serve a ruler or their minister with an excessive variety of curries: 
superbly sour, bitter, pungent, and sweet; hot and mild, and salty and bland. 
But that cook didn’t take their master’s hint: 
‘Today my master preferred this sauce, or he reached for it, or he took a lot of it, or he praised it. 
Today my master preferred the sour or bitter or pungent or sweet or hot or mild or salty sauce. Or he preferred the bland sauce, or he reached for the bland one, or he took a lot of it, or he praised it.’ 
That foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook doesn’t get presented with clothes, wages, or bonuses. 
Why is that? 
Because they don’t take their master’s hint. 
In the same way, a foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, their mind doesn’t enter immersion, and their corruptions aren’t given up. 
But they don’t take the hint. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
As they meditate observing an aspect of principles, the mind doesn’t enter immersion, and the corruptions aren’t given up. 
But they don’t take the hint. 
That foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant doesn’t get blissful meditations in this very life, nor do they get mindfulness and situational awareness. 
Why is that? 
Because they don’t take their mind’s hint. 
Suppose an astute, competent, skillful cook was to serve a ruler or their minister with an excessive variety of curries:

Because they take their mind’s hint.” 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )Sick ^n375 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the little village of Beluva. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī. 
I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.” 
“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, 
while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva. 
After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. 
But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. 
Then it occurred to the Buddha: 
“It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha. 
Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?” 
So that is what he did. 
Then the Buddha’s illness died down. 
Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out. 
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable, 
that he’s well, 
and that he’s alright. 
Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings didn’t spring to mind. 
Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that 
the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without bringing something up regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.” 
“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now, Ānanda? 
I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings. 
The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings. 
If there’s anyone who thinks: 
‘I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them bring something up regarding the Saṅgha. 
But the Realized One doesn’t think like this, 

so why should he bring something up regarding the Saṅgha? 
Now I am old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. 
I’m currently eighty years old. 
Just as a decrepit old cart keeps going by relying on straps, 
in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going as if it were relying on straps. 
Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable. 
So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. 
And how does a mendicant do this? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. 
Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.” 

1. In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove )The Nuns’ Quarters ^n376 Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the nuns’ quarters, and sat down on the seat spread out. 
Then several nuns went up to Venerable Ānanda bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Honorable Ānanda, several nuns meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They have realized a higher distinction than they had before.” 
“That’s how it is, sisters! That’s how it is, sisters! 
Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to 
realize a higher distinction than they had before.” 
Then Ānanda educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. 
Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 






“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! 
Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to 
realize a higher distinction than they had before. 
What four? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, based on the body there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. 
That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. 
As they do so, joy springs up. 
Being joyful, rapture springs up. 
When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. 
When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. 
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. 
Then they reflect: 
‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. 
Let me now pull back.’ 
They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. 
They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ 
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
As they meditate observing an aspect of principles, based on principles there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. 
That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. 
As they do so, joy springs up. 
Being joyful, rapture springs up. 
When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. 
When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. 
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. 
Then they reflect: 
‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. 
Let me now pull back.’ 
They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. 
They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ 
That’s how there is directed development. 
And how is there undirected development? 
Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ 
And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ 
And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ 
Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ 
And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ 
And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ 
Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’

Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ 
And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ 
And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ 
That’s how there is undirected development. 
So, Ānanda, I’ve taught you directed development and undirected development. 
Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. 
Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said. 







^cksn#s47b(2. At Nāḷandā )A Great Man ^n377 At Sāvatthī. 
Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, they speak of ‘a great man’. 
How is a great man defined?” 
“Sāriputta, someone whose mind is free is a great man, I say. 
If their mind is not free, I say they’re not a great man. 
And how does someone have a free mind? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, their mind becomes dispassionate, and is freed from the defilements by not grasping. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
As they meditate observing an aspect of principles, their mind becomes dispassionate, and is freed from the defilements by not grasping. 
That’s how someone has a free mind. 
Someone whose mind is free is a great man, I say. 
If their mind is not free, I say they’re not a great man.” 

2. At Nāḷandā )At Nāḷandā ^n378 At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. 
Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that 
I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.” 
“That’s a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying: 
‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that 
I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’ 
What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that 
those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” 
“No, sir.” 
“And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that 
those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” 
“No, sir.” 
“And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that 
I have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” 
“No, sir.” 
“Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present, 
what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?” 


“Sir, though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present, 
still I understand this by inference from the teaching. 
Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. 
And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. 
As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. 
He thinks, 
‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’ 
In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: 
‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’” 


“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
So Sāriputta, you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. 
Though there will be some foolish people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear this exposition of the teaching they’ll give up that doubt or uncertainty.” 

2. At Nāḷandā )With Cunda ^n379 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
At that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying in the Magadhan lands near the little village of Nālaka, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
And the novice Cunda was his carer. 
Then Venerable Sāriputta became fully extinguished because of that sickness. 
Then Cunda took Sāriputta’s bowl and robes and set out for Sāvatthī. He went to see Venerable Ānanda at Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished. 
This is his bowl and robe.” 
“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter. 
Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. 
Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, this novice Cunda says that 
Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished. 
This is his bowl and robe. 
Since I heard this, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, and the teachings don’t spring to mind.” 
“Well, Ānanda, when Sāriputta became fully extinguished, did he take away your entire spectrum of ethical conduct, of immersion, of wisdom, of freedom, or of the knowledge and vision of freedom?” 
“No, sir, he did not. 



But Venerable Sāriputta was my adviser and counselor. He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his spiritual companions. 
I remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable Sāriputta.” 
“Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that 
we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? 
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? 
That is not possible. 
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branch fell off. 
In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta has become fully extinguished. 
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? 
That is not possible. 
So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. 
And how does a mendicant do this? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. 
Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.” 

2. At Nāḷandā )At Ukkacelā ^n380 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. It was not long after Sāriputta and Moggallāna had become fully extinguished. 
Now, at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of mendicants. 
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were silent. He addressed them: 
“Mendicants, this assembly seems empty to me now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished. 
When Sāriputta and Moggallāna were alive, my assembly was never empty; I had no concern for any region where they stayed. 
The Buddhas of the past or the future have pairs of chief disciples who are no better than 
Sāriputta and Moggallāna were to me. 

It’s an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples 
that they fulfill the Teacher’s instructions and follow his advice. And they’re liked and approved, respected and admired by the four assemblies. 
And it’s an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One 
that when such a pair of disciples becomes fully extinguished he does not sorrow or lament. 
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? 
That is not possible. 
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branches fell off. 
In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished. 
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? 
That is not possible. 
So mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. 
And how does a mendicant do this? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. 
Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.” 

2. At Nāḷandā )With Bāhiya ^n381 At Sāvatthī. 
Then Venerable Bāhiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 
“Well then, Bāhiya, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. 
What is the starting point of skillful qualities? 
Well purified ethics and correct view. 
When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics. 
What four? 
Meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
When you develop these four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.” 
And then Venerable Bāhiya approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
Then Bāhiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And Venerable Bāhiya became one of the perfected. 

2. At Nāḷandā )With Uttiya ^n382 At Sāvatthī.

And then Venerable Uttiya approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
Then Uttiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”

2. At Nāḷandā )Noble ^n383 “Mendicants, when these four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated they are noble and emancipating, and bring one who practices them to the complete ending of suffering.

When these four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated they are noble and emancipating, and bring one who practices them to the complete ending of suffering.” 

2. At Nāḷandā )With Brahmā ^n384 At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
“The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. 
What four? 
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
or mind … 
or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.” 
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. 
What four? 
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
or mind … 
or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.” 
That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. 
Then he went on to say: 
“The compassionate one, <j>who sees the ending of rebirth, 
understands the path to convergence. 
By this path people crossed over before, 
will cross, and are crossing.” 

2. At Nāḷandā )At Sedaka ^n385 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, an acrobat set up his bamboo pole and said to his apprentice Medakathālikā, 
‘Come now, dear Medakathālikā, climb up the bamboo pole and stand on my shoulders.’ 
‘Yes, teacher,’ she replied. She climbed up the bamboo pole and stood on her teacher’s shoulders. 
Then the acrobat said to Medakathālikā, 
‘You look after me, dear Medakathālikā, and I’ll look after you. 
That’s how, guarding and looking after each other, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’ 
When he said this, Medakathālikā said to her teacher, 
‘That’s not how it is, teacher! 
You should look after yourself, and I’ll look after myself. 
That’s how, guarding and looking after ourselves, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’ 
That’s the way,” said the Buddha. “It’s just as Medakathālikā said to her teacher. 
Thinking ‘I’ll look after myself,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. 
Thinking ‘I’ll look after others,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. 
Looking after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you look after yourself. 
And how do you look after others by looking after yourself? 
By development, cultivation, and practice of meditation. 

And how do you look after yourself by looking after others? 
By acceptance, harmlessness, love, and sympathy. 

Thinking ‘I’ll look after myself,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. 
Thinking ‘I’ll look after others,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. 
Looking after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you look after yourself.” 

2. At Nāḷandā )The Finest Lady in the Land ^n386 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, suppose that on hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land! The finest lady in the land!’ a large crowd would gather. 
And the finest lady in the land would dance and sing in a most thrilling way. 
On hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing! The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing!’ an even larger crowd would gather. 
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, this is a bowl full to the brim with oil. You must carry it in between this large crowd and the finest lady in the land. 
And a man with a drawn sword will follow right behind you. 
Wherever you spill even a drop, he’ll chop off your head right there.’ 
What do you think, mendicants? 
Would that person lose focus on that bowl, and negligently get distracted outside?” 
“No, sir.” 
“I’ve made up this simile to make a point. 
And this is what it means. 
‘A bowl of oil filled to the brim’ is a term for mindfulness of the body. 
So you should train like this: 
‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’ 
That’s how you should train.”

5. The Deathless )Origin ^n408 “Mendicants, I will teach you the origin and the ending of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
Listen … 
And what is the origin of the body? 
The body originates from food. 
When food ceases, the body ends. 
Feelings originate from contact. 
When contact ceases, feelings end. 
The mind originates from name and form. 
When name and form cease, the mind ends. 
Principles originate from attention. 
When focus ends, principles end.” 

5. The Deathless )The Path ^n409 At Sāvatthī. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, at one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 
‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. 
What four? 
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
or mind … 
or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.’ 
And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me. 
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. 
What four? 
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
or mind … 
or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.’ 
That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. 
Then he went on to say: 
“The compassionate one, <j>who sees the ending of rebirth, 
understands the path to convergence. 
By this path people crossed over before, 
will cross over, and are crossing over.’” 

5. The Deathless )Mindful ^n410 “Mendicants, a mendicant should live mindfully. 
This is my instruction to you.

5. The Deathless )A Heap of the Skillful ^n411 “Rightly speaking, mendicants, you’d call these four kinds of mindfulness meditation a ‘heap of the skillful’.

5. The Deathless )Restraint in the Monastic Code ^n412 Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 
“Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. 
What is the starting point of skillful qualities? 
Live restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.

principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
When you develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way, depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.” 
And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And that mendicant became one of the perfected. 

5. The Deathless )Bad Conduct ^n413 Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and said: 
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 
“Well then, mendicant, you should purify skillful qualities starting from the beginning. 
What is the beginning of skillful qualities? 
Give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. 


When you’ve done this, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics. 
What four?

And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

Someone who totally and utterly lacks these five faculties is an outsider who belongs with the ordinary persons, I say.” 

2. Weaker )Endowed ^n489 Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, they speak of someone who is ‘accomplished regarding the faculties’. 
How is someone accomplished regarding the faculties defined?” 
“Mendicant, it’s when a mendicant develops the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom that lead to peace and awakening. 
This is how someone who is accomplished regarding the faculties is defined.”

^cksn#s48e(5. Old Age )Old Age ^n511 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat warming his back in the last rays of the sun. 
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and while massaging the Buddha’s limbs he said: 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
how the complexion of your skin is no longer pure and bright. Your limbs are flaccid and wrinkled, and your body is stooped. And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in your faculties 
of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.” 
“That’s how it is, Ānanda. 
When young you’re liable to grow old; when healthy you’re liable to get sick; and when alive you’re liable to die. 
The complexion of the skin is no longer pure and bright. The limbs are flaccid and wrinkled, and the body is stooped. And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in the faculties 
of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“Curse this wretched old age, 
which makes you so ugly. 
That’s how much this delightful puppet 
is ground down by old age. 
Even if you live for a hundred years, 
you’ll still end up dying. 
Death spares no-one, 
but crushes all underfoot.” 

5. Old Age )The Brahmin Uṇṇābha ^n512 At Sāvatthī. 
Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. 
What five? 
The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. 
What do these five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to? What experiences their scopes and ranges?” 
“Brahmin, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. 
What five? 
The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. 
These five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to the mind. And the mind experiences their scopes and ranges.” 
“But Master Gotama, what does the mind have recourse to?” 
“The mind has recourse to mindfulness.” 
“But what does mindfulness have recourse to?” 
“Mindfulness has recourse to freedom.” 
“But what does freedom have recourse to?” 
“Freedom has recourse to extinguishment.” 
“But what does extinguishment have recourse to?” 
“This question goes too far, brahmin! You weren’t able to grasp the limit of questioning. 
For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life.” 
And then the brahmin Uṇṇābha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the eastern side. When the sun rises and a ray of light enters through a window, where would it land?” 
“On the western wall, sir.” 
“In the same way, the brahmin Uṇṇābha’s faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep. It’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
If he were to pass away at this time, he would be bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.” 

5. Old Age )At Sāketa ^n513 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer park at the Añjana Wood. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, is there a method in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties?” 
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 
“Mendicants, there is a method in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties. 
And what is that method? 
The faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. 
The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. 
The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. 
The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion. 
The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. 
Suppose that there was a river slanting, sloping, and inclining to the east, and in the middle was an island. 
There’s a method in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream. 
But there’s also a method in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams. 
And what’s the method in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream? 
By taking into account the water to the east and the west of the island, 
that river can be reckoned to have just one stream. 
And what’s the method in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams? 
By taking into account the water to the north and the south of the island, 
that river can be reckoned to have two streams. 
By the same method, the faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. 
The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. 
The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. 
The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion. 
The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. 
It’s because of developing and cultivating the five faculties that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” 

5. Old Age )At the Eastern Gate ^n514 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī at the eastern gate. 
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta: 
“Sāriputta, do you have faith that 
the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom, when developed and cultivated, culminate, finish, and end in the deathless?” 
“Sir, in this case I don’t rely on faith in the Buddha’s claim that 
the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom, when developed and cultivated, culminate, finish, and end in the deathless. 
There are those who have not known or seen or understood or realized or experienced this with wisdom. They may rely on faith in this matter. 

But there are those who have known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom. They have no doubts or uncertainties in this matter. 

I have known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom. 
I have no doubts or uncertainties that the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom, when developed and cultivated, culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
There are those who have not known or seen or understood or realized or experienced this with wisdom. They may rely on faith in this matter. 

But there are those who have known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom. They have no doubts or uncertainties that 
the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom, when developed and cultivated, culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.” 

5. Old Age )At the Eastern Monastery (1st) ^n515 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, how many faculties must a mendicant develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?” 
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” 
“A mendicant must develop and cultivate one faculty so that they can declare enlightenment. 

What one? The faculty of wisdom. When a noble disciple has wisdom, the faith, energy, mindfulness, and immersion that follow along with that become stabilized. 
This is the one faculty that a mendicant must develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’.” 

5. Old Age )At the Eastern Monastery (2nd) ^n516 The same setting. 
“Mendicants, how many faculties must a mendicant develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?” 
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” 
“A mendicant must develop and cultivate two faculties so that they can declare enlightenment. 

What two? 
Noble wisdom and noble freedom. 
For their noble wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. 
And their noble freedom is the faculty of immersion. 
These are the two faculties that a mendicant must develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment:

“Mendicants, how many faculties must a mendicant develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?” 
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” 
“A mendicant must develop and cultivate four faculties so that they can declare enlightenment. 

What four? 
The faculties of energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
These are the four faculties that a mendicant must develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’.”

“A mendicant must develop and cultivate five faculties so that they can declare enlightenment.

These are the five faculties that a mendicant must develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment:

5. Old Age )About Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer ^n519 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
Now at that time Venerable Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer had declared enlightenment: 
“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” 
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then they said, 


“What reason does Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer see for doing this?” 

“It’s because Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer has developed and cultivated three faculties that he declares enlightenment: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’ 
What three? 
The faculties of mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
It’s because Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer has developed and cultivated these three faculties that he declares enlightenment. 

What’s the culmination of these three faculties? 
They culminate in ending. 
In the ending of what? 
Of rebirth, old age, and death. 
It’s because he sees that they culminate in the ending of rebirth, old age, and death that Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer declares enlightenment: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’” 

5. Old Age )At Āpaṇa ^n520 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town called Āpaṇa. 
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta: 
“Sāriputta, would a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One have any doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions?” 
“Sir, a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One would have no doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions. 
You can expect that a faithful noble disciple will live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. 
For their energy is the faculty of energy. 
You can expect that a faithful and energetic noble disciple will be mindful, with utmost mindfulness and alertness, able to remember and recall what was said and done long ago. 
For their mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. 
You can expect that a faithful, energetic, and mindful noble disciple will, relying on letting go, gain immersion, gain unification of mind. 
For their samādhi is the faculty of immersion. 
You can expect that a faithful, energetic, mindful noble disciple with their mind immersed in samādhi will understand this: 
‘Transmigration has no known beginning. 
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. 
But when that dark mass of ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, that state is peaceful and sublime. 
That is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’ 
For their noble wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. 
When a noble disciple has tried again and again, recollected again and again, entered immersion again and again, and understood with wisdom again and again, they will be confident of this: 
‘I have previously heard of these things. 
But now I have direct meditative experience of them, and see them with penetrating wisdom.’ 
For their faith is the faculty of faith.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
Sāriputta, a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One would have no doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions. …” 
The Buddha then repeated Sāriputta’s answer word for word. 























^cksn#s48f(6. The Boar’s Cave )At Sālā ^n521 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near the brahmin village of Sālā. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, the lion, king of beasts, is said to be the best of animals in terms of strength, speed, and courage. 
In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the qualities that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened. 
And what are the qualities that lead to awakening? 
The faculties of faith, 
energy, 
mindfulness, 
immersion, 
and wisdom are qualities that lead to awakening, in that they lead to becoming awakened. 
The lion, king of beasts, is said to be the best of animals in terms of strength, speed, and courage. 
In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the qualities that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened.” 

6. The Boar’s Cave )In the Land of the Mallas ^n522 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town called Uruvelakappa. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, as long as noble knowledge hasn’t arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties are not stable and fixed. 
But when noble knowledge has arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties become stable and fixed. 
It’s just like in a bungalow. As long as the roof peak is not lifted into place, the rafters are not stable or fixed. 
But when the roof peak is lifted into place, the rafters become stable and fixed. 
In the same way, as long as noble knowledge hasn’t arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties are not stable and fixed. 
But when noble knowledge has arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties become stable and fixed. 
What four? 
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, and immersion. 
When a noble disciple has wisdom, the faith, energy, mindfulness, and immersion that follow along with that become stabilized.” 

6. The Boar’s Cave )A Trainee ^n523 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, is there a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee? And that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept?” 
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” 
“There is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee, and that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept. 
And what is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee? 
It’s when a mendicant who is a trainee truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
This is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. 
Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee reflects: 
‘Is there any other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true, as real, as accurate as that of the Buddha?’ 
They understand: 
‘There is no other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true, as real, as accurate as that of the Buddha.’ 
This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. 
Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee understands the five faculties: 
faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
And although they don’t have direct meditative experience of their destination, apex, fruit, and culmination, 
they do see them with penetrating wisdom. 
This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. 
And what is the way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept? 
It’s when a mendicant who is an adept understands the five faculties: 
faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
They have direct meditative experience of their destination, apex, fruit, and culmination, 
and they see them with penetrating wisdom. 
This is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept. 
Furthermore, a mendicant who is an adept understands the six faculties: 
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. 
They understand: ‘These six faculties will totally and utterly cease without anything left over. And no other six faculties will arise anywhere anyhow.’ 
This too is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept.” 

6. The Boar’s Cave )Footprints ^n524 “The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint, so an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. 
In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the steps that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened. 
And what are the steps that lead to awakening? 
The faculties of faith, 
energy, 
mindfulness, 
immersion, 
and wisdom are steps that lead to awakening, in that they lead to becoming awakened. 
The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint, so an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. 
In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the steps that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened.” 

6. The Boar’s Cave )Heartwood ^n525 “Of all kinds of fragrant heartwood, red sandalwood is said to be the best. 
In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the qualities that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened. 
And what are the qualities that lead to awakening? 
The faculties of faith, 
energy, 
mindfulness, 
immersion, 
and wisdom are qualities that lead to awakening, in that they lead to becoming awakened. 
Of all kinds of fragrant heartwood, red sandalwood is said to be the best. 
In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the qualities that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened.” 

6. The Boar’s Cave )Grounded ^n526 “Mendicants, when a mendicant is grounded in one thing the five faculties become developed, well developed. 
What one thing? 
Diligence. 
And what is diligence? 
It’s when a mendicant looks after their mind when it comes to defilements and things that stimulate defilements. 
As they do so the faculties of faith, 
energy, 
mindfulness, 
immersion, 
and wisdom are fully developed. 
That’s how when a mendicant is grounded in one thing the five faculties become developed, well developed.” 

6. The Boar’s Cave )With Brahmā Sahampati ^n527 At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
“When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless. 
What five? 
The faculties of faith, 
energy, 
mindfulness, 
immersion, 
and wisdom. 
When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.” 
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless. 
What five? 
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless. 
Once upon a time, sir, I lived the spiritual life under the fully awakened Buddha Kassapa. 
There they knew me as 
the mendicant Sahaka. 
Because of developing and cultivating these same five faculties I lost desire for sensual pleasures. When my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in a good place, in the Brahmā realm. 
There they know me as 
Brahmā Sahampati. 
That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
I know and see how when these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.” 

6. The Boar’s Cave )The Boar’s Cave ^n528 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain in the Boar’s Cave. 
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta: 
“Sāriputta, considering what benefit does a mendicant with defilements ended, while still alive, continue to show utmost devotion for the Realized One or his instructions?” 
“Sir, it is considering the supreme sanctuary that a mendicant with defilements ended, while still alive, continues to show utmost devotion for the Realized One or his instructions.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
For it is considering the supreme sanctuary that a mendicant whose defilements are ended, while still alive, continues to show utmost devotion for the Realized One or his instructions. 
And what is that supreme sanctuary?” 
“It’s when a mendicant with defilements ended develops the faculties of faith, 
energy, 
mindfulness, 
immersion, 
and wisdom, which lead to peace and awakening. 
It is considering this supreme sanctuary that a mendicant with defilements ended, while still alive, continues to show utmost devotion for the Realized One or his instructions.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
For this is that supreme sanctuary. 
And what is that utmost devotion that a mendicant with defilements ended, while still alive, continues to show towards the Realized One or his instructions?” 
“It’s when a mendicant with defilements ended maintains respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion. 
This is that utmost devotion.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
For this is that utmost devotion that a mendicant with defilements ended, while still alive, continues to show towards the Realized One or his instructions.”

1. At the Cāpāla Shrine )At the Cāpāla Shrine ^n822 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. 
Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: 
“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth. 
Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. 
Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out. 
Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. 
The Buddha said to him: 
“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely. 
Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it. 
The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.” 
But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. 
He didn’t beg the Buddha, 
“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. 
For a second time … 
and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: 
“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely. 
Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it. 
The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.” 
But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. 
He didn’t beg the Buddha, 
“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. 
Then the Buddha said to him, 
“Go now, Ānanda, 
at your convenience.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. 
And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him: 
“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
Sir, you once made this statement: 
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their own tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ 
Today you do have such monk disciples. 
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
Sir, you once made this statement: 
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … 
Today you do have such nun disciples. 
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
Sir, you once made this statement: 
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples … 
and laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … 
Today you do have such layman 
and laywoman disciples. 
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
Sir, you once made this statement: 
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ 
Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. 
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.” 
When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra, 
“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. 
Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” 
So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. 
When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. 
Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
“Comparing the incomparable <j>with the creation of prolonged life, 
the sage surrendered the life force. 
Happy inside, serene, 
he shattered self-creation like a suit of armor.” 







^cksn#s51b(2. Shaking the Stilt Longhouse )Before ^n823 At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: 
‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason for the development of the bases of psychic power?’ 
Then it occurred to me: 
‘It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. 
They think: “My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.” 
And they meditate perceiving continuity: 
as before, so after; as after, so before; 
as below, so above; as above, so below; 
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. 
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. 
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy … 






mental development … 






inquiry, and active effort. 
They think: “My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.” 
And they meditate perceiving continuity: 
as before, so after; as after, so before; 
as below, so above; as above, so below; 
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. 
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.’ 
When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. 
When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. 
When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. 
They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, 
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. 
They understand mind with hate … 
mind without hate … 
mind with delusion … 
mind without delusion … 
constricted mind … 
scattered mind … 
expansive mind … 
unexpansive mind … 
mind that is not supreme … 
mind that is supreme … 
mind immersed in samādhi … 
mind not immersed in samādhi … 
freed mind … 
They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’. 
When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. 
When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” 

2. Shaking the Stilt Longhouse )Very Fruitful ^n824 “Mendicants, when the four bases of psychic power are developed and cultivated they’re very fruitful and beneficial. 
How so? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. 
They think: ‘My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ 
And they meditate perceiving continuity: 
as before, so after; as after, so before; 
as below, so above; as above, so below;

2. Shaking the Stilt Longhouse )Immersion Due to Enthusiasm ^n825 “Mendicants, if a mendicant depends on enthusiasm in order to gain immersion, gain unification of mind,

2. Shaking the Stilt Longhouse )With Moggallāna ^n826 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. 
Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, 
“These spiritual companions of yours staying beneath the longhouse are restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties. 
Go, Moggallāna, and strike awe in those mendicants!” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. Then he used his psychic power to make the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe. 
Then those mendicants stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. 
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!” 
Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said: 
“Why do you, mendicants, stand to one side, shocked and awestruck?” 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!” 
“Wanting to strike awe in you, the mendicant Moggallāna made the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe. 
What do you think, mendicants? 
What things has the mendicant Moggallāna developed and cultivated so as to have such power and might?” 
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 
“Well then, mendicants, listen. 
The mendicant Moggallāna has become so powerful and mighty by developing and cultivating the four bases of psychic power. 
What four? 
Moggallāna develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm … 
energy … 
mental development … 
inquiry, and active effort. 
He thinks: ‘My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ 

And he meditates perceiving continuity: 
as before, so after; as after, so before; 
as below, so above; as above, so below; 
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. 
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, he develops a mind that’s full of radiance. 
The mendicant Moggallāna has become so powerful and mighty by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power. 
And by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power, the mendicant Moggallāna wields the many kinds of psychic power … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. … 
And by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power, the mendicant Moggallāna realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And he lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.” 

2. Shaking the Stilt Longhouse )The Brahmin Uṇṇābha ^n827 So I have heard. 
At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, 
“Master Ānanda, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?” 
“The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha, brahmin, is to give up desire.” 
“But is there a path and a practice for giving up that desire?” 
“There is.” 
“What is that path?” 
“It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm … 
energy … 
mental development … 
inquiry, and active effort. 
This is the path and the practice for giving up that desire.” 
“This being the case, Master Ānanda, the path is endless, not finite. 
For it’s not possible to give up desire by means of desire.” 
“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. 
What do you think, brahmin? 
Have you ever had a desire to walk to the park, 
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding desire faded away?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“Have you ever had the energy to walk to the park, 
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding energy faded away?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“Have you ever had the idea to walk to the park, 
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding idea faded away?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“Have you ever inquired regarding a walk to the park, 
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding inquiry faded away?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“In the same way, take a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. They formerly had the desire to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding desire faded away. 
They formerly had the energy to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding energy faded away. 
They formerly had the idea to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding idea faded away. 
They formerly inquired regarding attaining perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding inquiry faded away. 
What do you think, brahmin? 
This being the case, is the path endless or finite?” 
“Clearly, Master Ānanda, this being the case, the path is finite, not endless. 
Excellent, Master Ānanda! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

“Sir, do you have personal experience of going to the Brahmā realm by psychic power with a mind-made body?” 
“I do, Ānanda.” 
“But do you have personal experience of going to the Brahmā realm by psychic power with this body made up of the four primary elements?” 
“I do, Ānanda.” 
“It’s incredible and amazing that the Buddha is capable of going to the Brahmā realm by psychic power with a mind-made body! And that he has personal experience of going to the Brahmā realm by psychic power with this body made up of the four primary elements!” 
“Ānanda, the Realized Ones are incredible and have incredible qualities. They’re amazing and have amazing qualities. 
Sometimes the Realized One submerges his body in his mind and his mind in his body. He meditates after sinking into a perception of bliss and lightness in the body. 
At that time his body becomes lighter, softer, more workable, and more radiant.

^ck#s52(Anuruddha)^cksn#s52a(1. In Private )In Private (1st) ^n899 So I have heard. 
At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: 
“Whoever has missed out on these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has missed out on the noble path to the complete ending of suffering. 
Whoever has undertaken these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has undertaken the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.” 
Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna knew what Venerable Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he reappeared in front of Anuruddha, 
and said to him: 
“Reverend Anuruddha, how do you define the undertaking of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation by a mendicant?” 
“Reverend, it’s when a mendicant meditates observing the body internally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing the body externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
They meditate observing the body internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 
They meditate observing feelings internally …

They meditate observing the mind internally …

1. In Private )On the Bank of the Sutanu ^n901 At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī on the bank of the Sutanu. 
Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Anuruddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“What things has Venerable Anuruddha developed and cultivated to attain great direct knowledge?” 
“Reverends, I attained great direct knowledge by developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.

Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna came out of retreat, went to Anuruddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to Anuruddha:

“Reverend Sāriputta, a trainee mendicant should enter and remain in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.

1. In Private )The Ending of Craving ^n905 At Sāvatthī. 
There Venerable Anuruddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, mendicants!” 
“Reverend,” they replied. 
Anuruddha said this: 
“Reverends, when these four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated they lead to the ending of craving.

1. In Private )The Frankincense-Tree Hut ^n906 At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut. 
There Venerable Anuruddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east, 
a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying: 
‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’ 
What do you think, reverends? Would they succeed?” 
“No, reverend. 
Why is that? 
The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. 
It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west. 
That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.” 
“In the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, if rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying: 
‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you? 
Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl? 
Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’ 
It’s simply impossible for a mendicant who is developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation to resign the training and return to a lesser life. 
Why is that? 
Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life. 
And how does a mendicant develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? 
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body … 
feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
That’s how a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” 

1. In Private )In Ambapālī’s Mango Grove ^n907 At one time the venerables Anuruddha and Sāriputta were staying near Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s Mango Grove. 
Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Anuruddha, and said to him: 
“Reverend Anuruddha, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. 
What kind of meditation are you usually practicing these days?” 
“These days, reverend, I usually meditate with my mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
What four? 
I meditate observing an aspect of the body … 
feelings … 
mind … 
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
These days I usually meditate with my mind firmly established in these four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—usually meditates with their mind firmly established in these four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” 
“We’re so fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate, 
to have heard such a dramatic statement in the presence of Venerable Anuruddha.” 

1. In Private )Gravely Ill ^n908 At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Dark Forest. And he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Anuruddha, and said to him: 
“What meditation does Venerable Anuruddha practice so that physical pain doesn’t occupy his mind?” 
“Reverends, I meditate with my mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation so that physical pain doesn’t occupy my mind. 
What four? 
I meditate observing an aspect of the body …

“Mendicants, there are these four absorptions. 
What four? 
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
These are the four absorptions. 
The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. 
In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment. 
And how does a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions slant, slope, and incline to extinguishment?

1. One Thing )With Ariṭṭha ^n982 At Sāvatthī. 
There the Buddha … said: 
“Mendicants, do you develop mindfulness of breathing?” 
When he said this, Venerable Ariṭṭha said to him: 
“Sir, I develop mindfulness of breathing.” 
“But mendicant, how do you develop it?” 
“Sir, I’ve given up desire for sensual pleasures of the past. I’m rid of desire for sensual pleasures of the future. And I have eliminated perception of repulsion regarding phenomena internally and externally. 
Just mindful, I will breathe in. Mindful, I will breathe out. 
That’s how I develop mindfulness of breathing.” 
“That is mindfulness of breathing, Ariṭṭha; I don’t deny it. 
But as to how mindfulness of breathing is fulfilled in detail, 
listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” Ariṭṭha replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“And how is mindfulness of breathing fulfilled in detail? 
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. 
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. 
Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ …

1. One Thing )About Mahākappina ^n983 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time Venerable Mahākappina was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in front of him. 
The Buddha saw him, 
and addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, do you see any disturbance or trembling in that mendicant’s body?” 
“Sir, whenever we see that mendicant meditating—whether in the middle of the Saṅgha or alone in private—we never see any disturbance or trembling in his body.” 
“Mendicants, when an immersion has been developed and cultivated there’s no disturbance or trembling of the body or mind. That mendicant gets such immersion when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. 
And what is that immersion? 
When immersion due to mindfulness of breathing has been developed and cultivated there’s no disturbance or trembling of the body or mind. 
And how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated in such a way? 
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. 
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so that there’s no disturbance or trembling of the body or mind.” 

1. One Thing )The Simile of the Lamp ^n984 “Mendicants, when immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. 
How so? 
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. 
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. 
Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. 
Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too usually practiced this kind of meditation. 
And while I was usually practicing this kind of meditation neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. 
And my mind was freed from defilements by not grasping. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘May neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. And may my mind be freed from the defilements by not grasping.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘May I give up memories and thoughts of the lay life.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, may I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, may I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘With the fading away of rapture, may I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.”’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, may I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that “space is infinite”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that “consciousness is infinite”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that “there is nothing at all”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, may I enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
Now, a mendicant might wish: 
‘Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, may I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.’ 
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
When immersion due to mindfulness of breathing has been developed and cultivated in this way, if they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. 
If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. 
If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. 
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. 
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. 
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. 
Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ 
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’ 
Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. 
As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel. 
In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ 
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’” 

1. One Thing )At Vesālī ^n985 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Now at that time the Buddha spoke in many ways to the mendicants about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development. 
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, 
“Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for a fortnight. 
No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. 
Then those mendicants thought, 
“The Buddha spoke in many ways about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development.” They committed themselves to developing the many different facets of the meditation on ugliness. 
Becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with this body, they looked for someone to slit their wrists. 
Each day ten, twenty, or thirty mendicants slit their wrists. 
Then after a fortnight had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, 
“Ānanda, why does the mendicant Saṅgha seem so diminished?” 
Ānanda told the Buddha all that had happened, and said, 


“Sir, please explain another way for the mendicant Saṅgha to get enlightened.” 
“Well then, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Vesālī together in the assembly hall.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to him, and said, 
“Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. 
Please, sir, come at your convenience.” 
Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out, 
and addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. 
In the last month of summer, when the dust and dirt is stirred up, a large sudden storm disperses and settles it on the spot. 
In the same way, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. 
And how is it so developed and cultivated? 
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. 
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
That’s how this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so that it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise.” 

1. One Thing )With Kimbila ^n986 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. 
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Kimbila, 
“Kimbila, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” 
When he said this, Kimbila kept silent. 
For a second time … 
And for a third time, the Buddha said to him, 
“How is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” 
And a second time and a third time Kimbila kept silent. 
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! 
Let the Buddha speak on immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 
“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Ānanda, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial? 
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. 
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. 
There’s a time when a mendicant is breathing in heavily, and they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ 
When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling physical processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling physical processes.’ 
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Why is that? 
Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say. 
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mental processes.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling mental processes.’ 
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Why is that? 
Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say. 
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out gladdening the mind.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in samādhi.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ 
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Why is that? 
Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say. 
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’ 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Having seen with wisdom the giving up of covetousness and bitterness, they watch closely over with equanimity. 
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Suppose there was a large heap of sand at the crossroads. 
And a cart or chariot were to come by from the east, 
west, 
north, 
or south and destroy that heap of sand. 
In the same way, when a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body, 
feelings, 
mind, 
or principles, they destroy bad, unskillful qualities.” 







^cksn#s54b(Chapter Two )Icchānaṅgala ^n987 At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. 
There he addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for three months. 
No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. 
Then after three months had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow another religion were to ask you: 
‘Reverends, what was the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence?’ You should answer them like this. 
‘Reverends, the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence was immersion due to mindfulness of breathing.’ 
In this regard: mindful, I breathe in. Mindful, I breathe out. 
Breathing in heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ 
When breathing in lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ 
I know: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ … 
I know: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ I know: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
For if anything should be rightly called 
‘the meditation of a noble one’, or else ‘the meditation of a Brahmā’, or else ‘the meditation of a realized one’, 
it’s immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

For those mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to the ending of defilements. 
For those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness. 
For if anything should be rightly called 
‘the meditation of a noble one’, or else ‘the meditation of a Brahmā’, or else ‘the meditation of a realized one’, 
it’s immersion due to mindfulness of breathing.” 


Chapter Two )In Doubt ^n988 At one time Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, is the meditation of a trainee just the same as the meditation of a Realized One? Or is the meditation of a trainee different from the meditation of a Realized One?” 
“Reverend Mahānāma, the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are not the same; 
they are different. 
Those mendicants who are trainees haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring for the supreme sanctuary. They meditate after giving up the five hindrances. 
What five? 
The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, 
dullness and drowsiness, 
restlessness and remorse, 
and doubt. 
Those who are trainee mendicants … meditate after giving up the five hindrances. 
Those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—for them, the five hindrances are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. 
What five? 
The hindrances of sensual desire, 
ill will, 
dullness and drowsiness, 
restlessness and remorse, 
and doubt. 
Those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements … for them, the five hindrances are cut off at the root … and unable to arise in the future. 
And here’s another way to understand how 
the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are different.

This is another way to understand how 
the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are different.” 

Chapter Two )With Ānanda (1st) ^n989 At Sāvatthī. 
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things; and those four things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seven things; and those seven things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill two things?” 
“There is, Ānanda.” 
“Sir, what is that one thing?” 
“Immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. And the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors. And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom. 
And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? 
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. 
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. 
Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ …

At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Why is that? 
Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say. 
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world.

They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling mental processes.’ 
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
Why is that? 
Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say. 
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’

immersing the mind in samādhi … 
freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’

Having seen with wisdom the giving up of covetousness and bitterness, they watch closely over with equanimity. 
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. 
That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 
And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors? 
Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body, 
their mindfulness is established and lucid. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. 
As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that principle with wisdom. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it. 

As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it. 

When you’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it. 

When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it. 

When the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it. 

They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. 

Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings … 
mind … 
principles, 
their mindfulness is established and lucid. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. … 

(Tell in full as for the first kind of mindfulness meditation.) 
They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi. 
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. 

That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors. 
And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, 
investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” 

Chapter Two )With Ānanda (2nd) ^n990 Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Ānanda, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things; and those four things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seven things; and those seven things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill two things?” 
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” 
“There is, Ānanda.

“There is, mendicants.” 
“Sir, what is that one thing?” 
“Immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.

Chapter Two )Several Mendicants (2nd) ^n992 Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them: 
“Mendicants, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things; and those four things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seven things; and those seven things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill two things?”

And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom. 
And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? 
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. … 




































































That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” 

Chapter Two )Giving Up the Fetters ^n993 “Mendicants, when immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it leads to giving up the fetters …” 

Chapter Two )Uprooting the Tendencies ^n994 “Mendicants, when immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it leads to uprooting the underlying tendencies …” 

Chapter Two )Completely Understanding the Course of Time ^n995 “Mendicants, when immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it leads to completely understanding the course of time …” 

Chapter Two )The Ending of Defilements ^n996 “Mendicants, when immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it leads to the ending of defilements. 
And how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to lead to giving up the fetters, 
uprooting the underlying tendencies, 
completely understanding the course of time, 
and ending the defilements? 
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. … 
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so as to lead to giving up the fetters, 
uprooting the underlying tendencies, 
completely understanding the course of time, 
and ending the defilements.”

^ck#s55(Stream-Entry)^cksn#s55a(1. At Bamboo Gate )A Wheel-Turning Monarch ^n997 At Sāvatthī. 
There the Buddha … said: 
“Mendicants, suppose a wheel-turning monarch were to rule as sovereign lord over these four continents. And when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. There he entertains himself in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Still, as he’s lacking four things, he’s not exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. He’s not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 
Now suppose a noble disciple wears rags and feeds on scraps of almsfood. Still, as they have four things, they’re exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 
What four? 
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
They have experiential confidence in the teaching: 
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 
They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ 
Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. 
These are the four qualities that they have. 
And, mendicants, gaining these four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of gaining these four things.” 

1. At Bamboo Gate )The Culmination of the Spiritual Life ^n998 “Mendicants, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
What four? 
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. 
A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“Those who have faith and ethics, 
confidence, and vision of the truth, 
in time arrive at happiness, 
the culmination of the spiritual life.” 

1. At Bamboo Gate )With Dīghāvu ^n999 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Now at that time the lay follower Dīghāvu was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
Then he addressed his father, the householder Jotika, 
“Please, householder, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: 
‘Sir, the lay follower Dīghāvu is sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
He bows with his head to your feet.’ 
And then say: 
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” 
“Yes, dear,” replied Jotika. He did as Dīghāvu asked. 




The Buddha consented with silence. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the lay follower Dīghāvu, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to him, 
“I hope you’re keeping well, Dīghāvu; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 
“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” 
“So, Dīghāvu, you should train like this: 
‘I will have experiential confidence in the Buddha … 
the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And I will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ 
That’s how you should train.” 
“Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I exhibit them. 
For I have experiential confidence in the Buddha … 
the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And I have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.” 
“In that case, Dīghāvu, grounded on these four factors of stream-entry you should further develop these six things that play a part in realization. 
You should meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation. 
That’s how you should train.” 
“These six things that play a part in realization that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I exhibit them. 
For I meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation. 
But still, sir, I think, 
‘I hope Jotika doesn’t suffer anguish when I’ve gone.’” 
Jotika said, “Dear Dīghāvu, don’t focus on that. 
Come on, dear Dīghāvu, you should closely focus on what the Buddha is saying.” 
When the Buddha had given this advice he got up from his seat and left. 
Not long after the Buddha left, Dīghāvu passed away. 
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, the lay follower named Dīghāvu, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away. 
Where has he been reborn in his next life?” 
“Mendicants, the lay follower Dīghāvu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. 
With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously, and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.” 

1. At Bamboo Gate )With Sāriputta (1st) ^n1000 At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat … and said to Sāriputta: 
“Reverend, how many things do people have to possess in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” 
“Reverend, people have to possess four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
What four? 
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …

the Saṅgha … 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. 
People have to possess these four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” 

1. At Bamboo Gate )With Sāriputta (2nd) ^n1001 Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Sāriputta, they speak of a ‘factor of stream-entry’. 
What is a factor of stream-entry?” 
“Sir, the factors of stream-entry are associating with good people, listening to the true teaching, proper attention, and practicing in line with the teaching.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
For the factors of stream-entry are associating with good people, listening to the true teaching, proper attention, and practicing in line with the teaching. 
Sāriputta, they speak of ‘the stream’. 
What is the stream?” 
“Sir, the stream is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
For the stream is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
Sāriputta, they speak of ‘a stream-enterer’. 
What is a stream-enterer?” 
“Sir, anyone who possesses this noble eightfold path is called a stream-enterer, the venerable of such and such name and clan.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
For anyone who possesses this noble eightfold path is called a stream-enterer, the venerable of such and such name and clan.” 

1. At Bamboo Gate )The Chamberlains ^n1002 At Sāvatthī. 
At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that 
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. 
Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa were residing in Sādhuka on some business. 
They heard about this. 


So they posted someone on the road, saying: 
“My good man, let us know when you see the Blessed One coming, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” 
And that person stood there for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. 
When they saw him, they went to the chamberlains and said: 
“Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming. 
Please come at your convenience.” 
Then the chamberlains went up to the Buddha, bowed, and followed behind him. 
And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and sat down on the seat spread out. 
The chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa bowed, sat down to one side, 
and said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, when we hear that 
you will be setting out from Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that 
you will be far from us. 
And when we hear that 
you are setting out from Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that 
you are far from us. 
And when we hear that 
you will be setting out from the Kosalan lands to wander in the Mallian lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that 
you will be far from us. 
And when we hear that 
you are setting out from the Kosalan lands to wander in the Mallian lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that 
you are far from us. 
And when we hear that 
you will be setting out from the Mallian lands to wander in the Vajjian lands … 





you will be setting out from the Vajjian lands to wander in the Kāsian lands … 





you will be setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in the Magadhan lands … 


you are setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in the Magadhan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that 
you are far from us. 
But when we hear that 
you will be setting out from the Magadhan lands to wander in the Kāsian lands, we’re happy and joyful, thinking that 
you will be near to us. 
And when we hear that 
you are setting out from the Magadhan lands to wander in the Kāsian lands … 


you will be setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in the Vajjian lands … 





you will be setting out from the Vajjian lands to wander in the Mallian lands … 





you will be setting out from the Mallian lands to wander in the Kosalan lands … 





you will be setting out in the Kosalan lands to wander to Sāvatthī, we’re happy and joyful, thinking that 
you will be near to us. 
And when we hear that 
you are staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery we have no little happiness and joy, thinking that 
you are near to us.” 
“Well then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. 
Just this much is enough to be diligent.” 
“Sir, for us there is something that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.” 
“What is that?” 
“Sir, it’s when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to go and visit a park. We have to harness and prepare his royal elephants. Then we have to seat his dear and beloved wives on the elephants, one in front of us, and one behind. 
Those sisters smell like a freshly opened perfume box; that’s how the royal ladies smell with makeup on. 
The touch of those sisters is like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok; that’s how dainty the royal ladies are. 
Now at that time we must look after the elephants, the sisters, and ourselves. 
But we don’t recall having a bad thought regarding those sisters. 
This is that thing that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.” 
“Well then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. 
Just this much is enough to be diligent. 
A noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
What four? 
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
They live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. 
A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
And you have experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And whatever there is in your family that’s available to give, you share it all with those who are ethical, of good character. 
What do you think, chamberlains? 
How many people among the Kosalans are your equal 
when it comes to giving and sharing?” 
“We’re fortunate, sir, so very fortunate, 
in that the Buddha understands us like this.” 

1. At Bamboo Gate )The People of Bamboo Gate ^n1003 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Bamboo Gate. 
The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard: 
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes. 
We wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi; to wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and to accept gold and money. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
Given that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.” 
“Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself. 
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“And what is the explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself? 
It’s when a noble disciple reflects: 
‘I want to live and don’t want to die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain. 
Since this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that. 
But others also want to live and don’t want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. 
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. 
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ 
Reflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures. 
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
‘If someone were to steal from me, I wouldn’t like that. 
But if I were to steal from someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. 
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. 
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ 
Reflecting in this way, they give up stealing themselves. And they encourage others to give up stealing, praising the giving up of stealing. 
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
‘If someone were to have sexual relations with my wives, I wouldn’t like it. 
But if I were to have sexual relations with someone else’s wives, he wouldn’t like that either. 
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. 
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’ 
Reflecting in this way, they give up sexual misconduct themselves. And they encourage others to give up sexual misconduct, praising the giving up of sexual misconduct. 
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
‘If someone were to distort my meaning by lying, I wouldn’t like it. 
But if I were to distort someone else’s meaning by lying, they wouldn’t like it either. 
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by someone else. 
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’ 
Reflecting in this way, they give up lying themselves. And they encourage others to give up lying, praising the giving up of lying. 
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
‘If someone were to break me up from my friends by divisive speech, I wouldn’t like it. 
But if I were to break someone else from their friends by divisive speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’ 
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
‘If someone were to attack me with harsh speech, I wouldn’t like it. 
But if I were to attack someone else with harsh speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’ 

So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
‘If someone were to annoy me by talking silliness and nonsense, I wouldn’t like it. 
But if I were to annoy someone else by talking silliness and nonsense, they wouldn’t like it either.’ 
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by another. 
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on another?’ 
Reflecting in this way, they give up talking nonsense themselves. And they encourage others to give up talking nonsense, praising the giving up of talking nonsense. 
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 
And they have experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. 
When a noble disciple has these seven good qualities and these four desirable states they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” 
When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! … 
We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 

1. At Bamboo Gate )In the Brick Hall (1st) ^n1004 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house. 
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has passed away. 
Where has he been reborn in his next life? 
The nun named Nandā, 

the layman named Sudatta, 

and the laywoman named Sujātā have passed away. 
Where have they been reborn in the next life?” 
“Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha passed away having realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
The nun Nandā passed away having ended the five lower fetters. She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. 
The layman Sudatta passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. 
The laywoman Sujātā passed away having ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away. 
But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone dies that would be a bother for me. 
So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 
And what is that mirror of the teaching? 

It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … 
the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. 
This is that mirror of the teaching.

‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” 

(The following two discourses have the same setting.) 
1. At Bamboo Gate )At the Brick Hall (2nd) ^n1005 Ānanda said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, the monk named Asoka has passed away. 
Where has he been reborn in his next life? 
The nun named Asokā, 
the layman named Asoka, 
and the laywoman named Asokā have passed away. 
Where have they been reborn in the next life?” 
“Ānanda, the monk Asoka passed away having realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life … 
(And all is explained as in SN 55.8.) 
This is that mirror of the teaching. 
A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” 

1. At Bamboo Gate )At the Brick Hall (3rd) ^n1006 Ānanda said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, the layman named Kakkaṭa has passed away in Ñātika. 
Where has he been reborn in his next life? 
The laymen named Kaḷibha, 
Nikata, 
Kaṭissaha, 
Tuṭṭha, 
Santuṭṭha, 
Bhadda, and 
Subhadda have passed away in Ñātika. 
Where have they been reborn in the next life?” 
“Ānanda, the laymen Kakkaṭa, 
Kaḷibha, 
Nikata, 
Kaṭissaha, 
Tuṭṭha, 
Santuṭṭha, 
Bhadda, 
and Subhadda passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. 

Over fifty laymen in Ñātika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. 
More than ninety laymen in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. 
In excess of five hundred laymen in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away. 
But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone passes away, that would be a bother for me. 
So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 
And what is that mirror of the teaching? 

It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …

the Saṅgha … 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.

^cksn#s55b(2. The Royal Monastery )A Saṅgha of a Thousand Nuns ^n1007 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Royal Monastery. 
Then a Saṅgha of a thousand nuns went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to them: 
“Nuns, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
What four? 
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …

A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” 

2. The Royal Monastery )The Brahmins ^n1008 At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, the brahmins advocate a practice called ‘get up and go’. 
They encourage their disciples: 
‘Please, good people, rising early you should face east and walk. 
Do not avoid a pit, a cliff, a stump, thorny ground, a swamp, or a sewer. 
You should await death in the place that you fall. 
And when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a good place, a heaven realm.’ 
But this practice of the brahmins is a foolish procedure, a stupid procedure. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, or extinguishment. 
But in the training of the Noble One I advocate a ‘get up and go’ practice 
which does lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
And what is that ‘get up and go’ practice? 

It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …

the Saṅgha … 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. 
This is that ‘get up and go’ practice

2. The Royal Monastery )With the Senior Monk Ānanda ^n1009 At one time the venerables Ānanda and Sāriputta were staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him: 
“Reverend, how many things do people have to give up and how many do they have to possess in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” 
“Reverend, people have to give up four things and possess four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
What four? 
They don’t have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
And they do have the experiential confidence in the Buddha that causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
They don’t have the distrust in the teaching that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
And they do have the experiential confidence in the teaching that causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 
They don’t have the distrust in the Saṅgha that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
And they do have the experiential confidence in the Saṅgha that causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration with joined palms.’ 
They don’t have the unethical conduct that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
And they do have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones that causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
Their ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. 
People have to give up these four things and possess these four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”

^cksn#s55c(3. About Sarakāni )With Mahānāma (1st) ^n1017 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, this Kapilavatthu is successful and prosperous and full of people, with cramped cul-de-sacs. 
In the late afternoon, after paying homage to the Buddha or an esteemed mendicant, I enter Kapilavatthu. 
I encounter a stray elephant, 
horse, 
chariot, 
cart, 
or person. 
At that time I lose mindfulness regarding the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. 
I think: 
‘If I were to die at this time, where would I be reborn in my next life?’” 
“Do not fear, Mahānāma, do not fear! 
Your death will not be a bad one; your passing will not be a bad one. 
Take someone whose mind has for a long time been imbued with faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Their body consists of form, made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. 
Right here the crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures devour it. 
But their mind rises up, headed for a higher place. 
Suppose a person was to sink a pot of ghee or oil into a deep lake and break it open. 
Its shards and chips would sink down, while the ghee or oil in it would rise up, headed for a higher place. 
In the same way, take someone whose mind has for a long time been imbued with faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.

3. About Sarakāni )With Godhā the Sakyan ^n1019 At Kapilavatthu. 
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to Godhā the Sakyan, and said to him, 
“Godhā, how many things must a person have for you to recognize them as a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” 
“Mahānāma, a person must have three things for me to recognize them as a stream-enterer.

“Hold on, Mahānāma, hold on! 
Only the Buddha would know whether or not they have these things.” 
“Come, Godhā, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.” 
Then Mahānāma and Godhā went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahānāma told the Buddha all that had happened, and then said: 
























“Sir, some issue regarding the teaching might come up. The Buddha might take one side, and the Saṅgha of monks the other. 
I’d side with the Buddha. 
May the Buddha remember me as having such confidence. 
Some issue regarding the teaching might come up. The Buddha might take one side, and the Saṅgha of monks and the Saṅgha of nuns the other. …

May the Buddha remember me as having such confidence.” 
“Godhā, what do you have to say to Mahānāma when he speaks like this?” 
“Sir, I have nothing to say to Mahānāma when he speaks like this, except what is good and wholesome.” 

3. About Sarakāni )About Sarakāni (1st) ^n1020 At Kapilavatthu. 
Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan had passed away. 
The Buddha declared that he was 
a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
At that, several Sakyans came together complaining, grumbling, and objecting, 
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
Who can’t become a stream-enterer these days? 
For the Buddha even declared Sarakāni to be a stream-enterer after he passed away. 


Sarakāni was too weak for the training; he used to drink alcohol.” 
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: 










“Mahānāma, when a lay follower has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, how could they go to the underworld?

3. About Sarakāni )Anāthapiṇḍika (1st) ^n1022 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
Then he addressed a man, 
“Please, mister, go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: 
‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
He bows with his head to your feet.’ 
And then say: 
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” 
“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked. 




Sāriputta consented with silence. 
Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍika’s home. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika, 
“I hope you’re keeping well, householder; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 
“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” 
“Householder, you don’t have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
And you have experiential confidence in the Buddha: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’

‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals.

And then Anāthapiṇḍika’s pain died down on the spot. 
Then he served Sāriputta and Ānanda from his own dish. 
When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika took a low seat and sat to one side. 
Venerable Sāriputta expressed his appreciation to him with these verses. 
“Whoever has faith in the Realized One, 
unwavering and well grounded; 
whose ethical conduct is good, 
praised and loved by the noble ones; 
who has confidence in the Saṅgha, 
and correct view: 
they’re said to be prosperous, 
their life is not in vain. 
So let the wise devote themselves 
to faith, ethical behaviour, 
confidence, and insight into the teaching, 
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.” 
After expressing his appreciation to Anāthapiṇḍika with these verses, Sāriputta got up from his seat and left. 
Then Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
“So, Ānanda, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 
“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta advised the householder Anāthapiṇḍika in this way and that.” 
“Sāriputta is astute, Ānanda. 
He has great wisdom, since he can analyze the four factors of stream-entry in ten respects.”

Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
Then he addressed a man, 
“Please, mister, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: 
‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
He bows with his head to your feet.’ 
And then say: 
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” 
“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked. 




Ānanda consented with silence. 
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika. He sat down on the seat spread out and said to Anāthapiṇḍika, 
“I hope you’re keeping well, householder; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing; that its fading, not its growing, is apparent.” 
“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” 
“Householder, when an unlearned ordinary person has four things, they’re frightened and terrified, and fear what awaits them after death.

And of the training rules appropriate for laypeople taught by the Buddha, I don’t see any that I have broken.” 
“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate! 
You have declared the fruit of stream-entry.” 

3. About Sarakāni )Dangers and Threats (1st) ^n1024 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: 
“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 
What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? 
Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. 
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures. 
Anyone who steals … 
Anyone who commits sexual misconduct … 
Anyone who lies … 
Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. 
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled. 
What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? 
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. 
These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. 
And what is the noble system that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom? 
A noble disciple properly attends to dependent origination itself: 
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. 
When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.' That is: 
Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. 
This is the noble system that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom. 
When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”

3. About Sarakāni )With Nandaka the Licchavi ^n1026 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then Nandaka the Licchavi minister went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Nandaka, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

A noble disciple who has these four things is guaranteed long life, 
beauty, 
happiness, 
fame, 
and sovereignty, both human and divine. 
Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.” 
When he had spoken, a certain person said to Nandaka: 
“Sir, it is time to bathe.” 
“Enough now, my man, with that exterior bath. 
This interior bathing will do for me, that is, 
confidence in the Buddha.”

“And how does a noble disciple live negligently?

When they live negligently, there’s no joy.

And how does a noble disciple live diligently? 
Firstly, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

But they’re not content with that confidence, and make a further effort for solitude by day and retreat by night. 
When they live diligently, joy springs up.

“Whoever has faith in the Realized One, 
unwavering and well grounded; 
whose ethical conduct is good, 
praised and loved by the noble ones; 
who has confidence in the Saṅgha, 
and correct view: 
they’re said to be prosperous, 
their life is not in vain. 
So let the wise devote themselves 
to faith, ethical behaviour, 
confidence, and insight into the teaching, 
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.” 

6. A Wise Person )One Who Completed the Rains ^n1048 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Sāvatthī arrived at Kapilavatthu on some business. 
The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard about this. 
They went to that mendicant, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, we hope that the Buddha is healthy and well.” 
“He is, good sirs.” 
“And we hope that Sāriputta and Moggallāna are healthy and well.” 
“They are.” 
“And we hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and well.” 
“It is.” 
“But sir, during this rains residence did you hear and learn anything in the presence of the Buddha?” 
“Good sirs, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 
‘There are fewer mendicants who realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
There are more mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.’ 
In addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 
‘There are fewer mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. 
There are more mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, who come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’ 
In addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 
‘There are fewer mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, who come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. 
There are more mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.’” 

6. A Wise Person )With Dhammadinna ^n1049 At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. 
Then the lay follower Dhammadinna, together with five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“May the Buddha please advise 
and instruct us. It will be for our lasting welfare and happiness.” 
“So, Dhammadinna, you should train like this: 
‘From time to time we will undertake and dwell upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness.’ 
That’s how you should train yourselves.” 
“Sir, we live at home with our children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money. 
It’s not easy for us to undertake and dwell from time to time upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness. 
Since we are established in the five training rules, please teach us further.” 
“So, Dhammadinna, you should train like this: 
‘We will have experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And we will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ 
That’s how you should train yourselves.” 
“Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in us, and we embody them. 
For we have experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And we have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.” 
“You’re fortunate, Dhammadinna, so very fortunate! 
You have all declared the fruit of stream-entry.” 

6. A Wise Person )Sick ^n1050 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 
At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that 
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. 
Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this. 


Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him that he had heard that the Buddha was leaving. He added, 



“Sir, I haven’t heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha 
how a wise lay follower should advise another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill.” 
“Mahānāma, a wise lay follower should put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with four consolations. 
‘Be at ease, sir. 
You have experiential confidence in the Buddha … 

the teaching … 
the Saṅgha … 
And you have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ 
When a wise lay follower has put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with these four consolations, they should say: 
‘Are you concerned for your mother and father?’ 
If they reply, 
‘I am,’ they should say: 
‘But sir, it’s your nature to die. 
Whether or not you are concerned for your mother and father, 
you will die anyway. 
It would be good to give up concern for your mother and father.’ 
If they reply, 
‘I have given up concern for my mother and father,’ they should say: 
‘But are you concerned for your partners and children?’ 
If they reply, 
‘I am,’ they should say: 
‘But sir, it’s your nature to die. 
Whether or not you are concerned for your partners and children, 
you will die anyway. 
It would be good to give up concern for your partners and children.’ 
If they reply, 
‘I have given up concern for my partners and children,’ they should say: 
‘But are you concerned for the five kinds of human sensual stimulation?’ 
If they reply, 
‘I am,’ they should say: 
‘Good sir, heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasures. 
It would be good to turn your mind away from human sensual pleasures and fix it on the gods of the Four Great Kings.’ 
If they reply, 
‘I have done so,’ they should say: 
‘Good sir, the gods of the Thirty-Three are better than the gods of the Four Great Kings … 



Good sir, the gods of Yama … 
the Joyful Gods … 
the Gods Who Love to Create … 
the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … 
the Gods of the Brahmā realm are better than the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. 
It would be good to turn your mind away from the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others and fix it on the Gods of the Brahmā realm.’ 
If they reply, 
‘I have done so,’ they should say: 
‘Good sir, the Brahmā realm is impermanent, not lasting, and included within identity. 
It would be good to turn your mind away from the Brahmā realm and apply it to the cessation of identity.’ 
If they reply, 
‘I have done so,’ 
then there is no difference between a lay follower whose mind is freed in this way and a mendicant whose mind is freed from defilements; that is, 
between the freedom of one and the other.”

1. Immersion )Thoughts ^n1077 “Mendicants, don’t think bad, unskillful thoughts, such as

Why is that? 
Because those thoughts aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

That’s why you should practice meditation …” 







^cksn#s56b(2. Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma )Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma ^n1081 At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. 
There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants: 
“Mendicants, these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth. 
What two? 
Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless. 
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. 
And what is that middle way of practice? 
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. 
Now this is the noble truth of suffering. 
Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. 
Now this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. 
It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, chasing pleasure in various realms. That is, 
craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. 
Now this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. 
It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it. 
Now this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
‘This is the noble truth of suffering.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 
‘This noble truth of suffering should be completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This noble truth of suffering has been completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering should be given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering should be developed.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been developed.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 
As long as my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was not fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve aspects, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. 
But when my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve aspects, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. 
Knowledge and vision arose in me: 
‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, the group of five mendicants was happy with what the Buddha said. 
And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña: 
“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” 
And when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma, the earth gods raised the cry: 
“Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” 
Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings … 

the Gods of the Thirty-Three … 
the Gods of Yama … 
the Joyful Gods … 
the Gods Who Love to Create … 
the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … 
the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raised the cry: 
“Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” 
And so at that moment, in that instant, the cry soared up to the Brahmā realm. 
And this galaxy shook and rocked and trembled. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appeared in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods. 
Then the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
“Koṇḍañña has really understood! Koṇḍañña has really understood!” 
And that’s how Venerable Koṇḍañña came to be known as “Koṇḍañña Who Understood”. 

2. Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma )The Realized Ones ^n1082 “‘This is the noble truth of suffering.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in the Realized Ones regarding teachings not learned before from another.

2. Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma )Aggregates ^n1083 “Mendicants, there are these four noble truths. 
What four? 
The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
And what is the noble truth of suffering? 
You should say: ‘The five grasping aggregates’. 
That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
This is called the noble truth of suffering. 
And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? 
It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, chasing pleasure in various realms. That is, 
craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence.

2. Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma )Remembering (1st) ^n1085 “Mendicants, do you remember the four noble truths that I taught?” 
When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha: 
“I do, sir.” 
“How so, mendicant?” 
“Sir, I remember that suffering is the first noble truth you’ve taught; 
the origin of suffering is the second; 
the cessation of suffering is the third;

“How so, mendicant?” 
“Sir, I remember that suffering is the first noble truth you’ve taught. 
For if any ascetic or brahmin should say this: 
‘What the ascetic Gotama teaches is not the first noble truth of suffering. 
I’ll reject this first noble truth of suffering and describe another first noble truth of suffering.’

2. Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma )Ignorance ^n1087 Seated to one side, that mendicant said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, they speak of this thing called ‘ignorance’. 
What is ignorance? 
And how is an ignorant person defined?” 
“Not knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
This is called ignorance. 
And this is how an ignorant person is defined. 
That’s why you should practice meditation …” 

2. Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma )Knowledge ^n1088 Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

^cksn#s56c(3. At the Village of Koṭi )At the Village of Koṭi (1st) ^n1091 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis at the village of Koṭi. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four noble truths, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time. 
What four? 
The noble truths of suffering, 
the origin of suffering, 
the cessation of suffering, 
and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
These noble truths of suffering, origin, cessation, and the path have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“Because of not truly seeing 
the four noble truths, 
we have transmigrated for a long time 
from one rebirth to the next. 
But now that these truths have been seen, 
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated. 
The root of suffering is cut off, 
now there’ll be no more future lives.”

I don’t deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables don’t realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and don’t live having realized it with their own insight. 
There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
I deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and live having realized it with their own insight.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“There are those who don’t understand suffering 
and suffering’s cause, 
and where all suffering 
ceases with nothing left over. 
And they don’t know the path 
that leads to the stilling of suffering. 
They lack the heart’s release, 
as well as the release by wisdom. 
Unable to make an end, 
they continue to be reborn and grow old.

3. At the Village of Koṭi )The Fully Awakened Buddha ^n1093 At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, there are these four noble truths. 
What four? 
The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.

It is because he has truly woken up to these four noble truths that the Realized One is called ‘the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha’.

3. At the Village of Koṭi )With Gavampati ^n1100 At one time several mendicants were staying in the land of the Cetīs at Sahajāti. 
Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them: 
“Reverends, does someone who sees suffering also see the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?” 
When they said this, Venerable Gavampati said to those senior mendicants: 
“Reverends, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 
‘Someone who sees suffering also sees the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
Someone who sees the origin of suffering also sees suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
Someone who sees the cessation of suffering also sees suffering, the origin of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
Someone who sees the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering also sees suffering, the origin of suffering, and the cessation of suffering.’” 







^cksn#s56d(4. In a Rosewood Forest )In a Rosewood Forest ^n1101 At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī in a rosewood forest. 
Then the Buddha picked up a few rosewood leaves in his hand and addressed the mendicants: 
“What do you think, mendicants? 
Which is more: 
the few leaves in my hand, or those in the forest above me?” 
“Sir, the few leaves in your hand are a tiny amount. 
There are far more leaves in the forest above.” 
“In the same way, there is much more that I have directly known but have not explained to you. What I have explained is a tiny amount. 
And why haven’t I explained it? 
Because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
That’s why I haven’t explained it. 
And what have I explained? 
I have explained: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
And why have I explained this? 
Because it’s beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

4. In a Rosewood Forest )A Stick ^n1103 “Mendicants, suppose a stick was tossed up in the air. Sometimes it’d fall on its bottom and sometimes the top. 
It’s the same for sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. Sometimes they go from this world to the other world, and sometimes they come from the other world to this world.

4. In a Rosewood Forest )Clothes ^n1104 “Mendicants, if your clothes or head were on fire, what would you do about it?” 
“Sir, if our clothes or head were on fire, we’d apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness in order to extinguish it.” 
“Mendicants, regarding your burning head or clothes with equanimity, not paying attention to them, you should apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness to truly comprehending the four noble truths.

4. In a Rosewood Forest )A Hundred Spears ^n1105 “Mendicants, suppose there was a man with a lifespan of a hundred years. 
And someone might say to him: 
‘Come now, my good man, they’ll strike you with a hundred spears in the morning, at midday, and in the late afternoon. 
And you’ll live for a hundred years being struck with three hundred spears every day. But when a hundred years have passed, you will comprehend the four noble truths for the first time.’ 
For an earnest gentleman this is sufficient reason to submit. 
Why is that? 
Transmigration has no known beginning. 
No first point is found of blows by spears, swords, arrows, and axes. 
Now this may be so. 
But the comprehension of the four noble truths doesn’t come with pain or sadness, I say. 
Rather, the comprehension of the four noble truths comes only with pleasure and happiness, I say.

4. In a Rosewood Forest )Living Creatures ^n1106 “Suppose a person was to strip all the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in India, gather them together into one pile, 
and make them into stakes. 
Then they’d impale the large creatures in the ocean on large stakes; the medium-sized creatures on medium-sized stakes; and the small creatures on small stakes. 
They wouldn’t run out of sizable creatures in the ocean before 
using up all the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in India. 
There are far more small creatures in the ocean than this, so it wouldn’t be feasible to impale them on stakes. 
Why is that? 
Because of the small size of those life-forms. 
That’s how big the plane of loss is. 
A person accomplished in view, exempt from that vast plane of loss, truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.

The east wind wafts it west; the west wind wafts it east; the north wind wafts it south; and the south wind wafts it north.

^cksn#s56e(5. A Cliff )Speculation About the World ^n1111 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain person left Rājagaha, thinking ‘I’ll speculate about the world.’ They went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. 
Then that person saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. 
When he saw this he thought, 
‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! 
I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 
Then that person entered the city and informed a large crowd, 
‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! 
I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 
‘But how is it that you’re mad? How have you lost your mind? 
And what have you seen that doesn’t exist in the world?’ 
‘Sirs, I left Rājagaha, thinking “I’ll speculate about the world.” I went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. 
Then I saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. 
That’s why I’m mad, that’s why I’ve lost my mind. 
And that’s what I’ve seen that doesn’t exist in the world.’ 
‘Well, mister, you’re definitely mad, you’ve definitely lost your mind. 
And you’re seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 
But what that person saw was in fact real, not unreal. 
Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. 
The defeated and terrified demons entered the citadel of the demons through the lotus stalk only to confuse the gods. 
So mendicants, don’t speculate about the world. 
For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. 
Why is that? 
Because those thoughts aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
When you think something up, you should think: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.

“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to Inspiration Peak. 
A certain mendicant saw the big cliff there 
and said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, that big cliff is really huge and scary.

“But sir, what is it?” 
“Mendicant, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.

Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. 
He saw several Licchavi youths practicing archery near the town hall. They were shooting arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing. 
When he saw this he thought, 
“These Licchavi youths really are trained, so well trained, 
in that they shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing.” 
Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 





“What do you think, Ānanda? 
Which is harder and more challenging: 
to shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing? Or to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip?” 
“It’s more difficult and challenging, sir, to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip.” 
“Still, Ānanda, those who truly penetrate suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path penetrate something tougher than that.

“Only after a very long time, sir, if ever.” 
“That one-eyed turtle would poke its neck through the hole in that yoke sooner than a fool who has fallen to the underworld would be reborn as a human being, I say. 
Why is that? 
Because in that place there’s no principled or moral conduct, and no doing what is good and skillful. 
There they just prey on each other, preying on the weak. 
Why is that? 
It’s because they haven’t seen the four noble truths.

And that’s how unlikely it is for the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One to shine in the world. 
And now, mendicants, you have been reborn as a human being. A Realized One has arisen in the world, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. And the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One shines in the world.
