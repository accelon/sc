^ak#sn(Connected Discourses)^ck#s1(Deities)^cksn#s1a(1. A Reed )Crossing the Flood ^bk#sn1^n1 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“Good sir, how did you cross the flood?” 
“Neither standing nor swimming, sir, I crossed the flood.” 
“But in what way did you cross the flood neither standing nor swimming?” 
“When I stood still, I went under. 
And when I swam, I was swept away. 
That’s how I crossed the flood neither standing nor swimming.” 
“After a long time I see 
a brahmin extinguished. 
Neither standing nor swimming, 
he’s crossed over clinging to the world.” 
This is what that deity said, 
and the teacher approved. 

Then that deity, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. 
1. A Reed )Liberation ^n2 At Sāvatthī. 
Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“Good sir, do you understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion for sentient beings?” 
“I do, sir.” 
“But how is it that you understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion for sentient beings?” 
“With the ending of relish for rebirth, 
the finishing of perception and consciousness, 
and the cessation and stilling of feelings: 
that, sir, is how I understand liberation, 
emancipation, and seclusion for sentient beings.” 
1. A Reed )Led On ^n3 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“This life, so very short, is led onward; 
one led on to old age has no shelter. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
do good deeds that bring you to joy.” 
“This life, so very short, is led onward; 
one led on to old age has no shelter. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
a seeker of peace would drop the world’s bait.” 
1. A Reed )Time Flies ^n4 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Time flies, nights pass by, 
the stages of life leave us one by one. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
do good deeds that bring you to joy.” 
“Time flies, nights pass by, 
the stages of life leave us one by one. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
a seeker of peace would drop the world’s bait.” 
1. A Reed )Cut How Many? ^n5 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Cut how many? Drop how many? 
How many more should be developed? 
How many chains must a mendicant escape 
before you call them a flood-crosser?” 
“Five to cut, five to drop, 
and five more to develop. 
A mendicant must escape five chains 
before you call them a flood-crosser.” 
1. A Reed )Awake ^n6 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“How many sleep while others wake? 
How many wake among the sleeping? 
By how many do you gather dust? 
By how many are you cleansed?” 
“Five sleep while others wake. 
Five wake among the sleeping. 
By five you gather dust. 
By five you’re cleansed.” 
1. A Reed )Not Comprehending ^n7 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Those who don’t comprehend the teachings, 
who may be led astray by the doctrines of others; 
asleep, they have not woken up: 
it is time for them to wake!” 
“Those who clearly comprehend the teachings, 
who won’t be led astray by the doctrines of others; 
they’ve woken up, they rightly know, 
they live smoothly in the rough.” 
1. A Reed )Very Confused ^n8 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Those who are very confused about the teachings, 
who may be led astray by the doctrines of others; 
asleep, they have not woken up: 
it is time for them to wake!” 
“Those who are unconfused about the teachings, 
who won’t be led astray by the doctrines of others; 
they’ve woken up, they rightly know, 
they live smoothly in the rough.” 
1. A Reed )Fond of Conceit ^n9 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Someone who’s fond of conceit can’t be tamed, 
and someone without immersion can’t be a sage. 
Living negligent alone in the wilderness, 
they can’t pass beyond Death’s domain.” 
“Having given up conceit, serene within oneself, 
with a healthy heart, everywhere free; 
living diligent alone in the wilderness, 
they pass beyond Death’s domain.” 
1. A Reed )Wilderness ^n10 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Living in the wilderness, 
peaceful spiritual practitioners 
eat just one meal a day: 
so why is their complexion so clear?” 
“They don’t grieve for the past, 
nor do they long for the future; 
they feed on whatever comes that day, 
that’s why their complexion’s so clear. 
Because they long for the future, 
and grieve for the past, 
fools wither away, 
like a green reed mowed down.” 








^cksn#s1b(2. The Garden of Delight )The Garden of Delight ^n11 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain deity of the company of the Thirty-Three was amusing themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. On that occasion they recited this verse: 
‘They don’t know pleasure 
who don’t see the Garden of Delight! 
It’s the abode of lordly gods, 
the glorious host of Thirty!’ 
When they had spoken, another deity replied with this verse: 
‘Fool, don’t you understand 
the saying of the perfected ones: 
All conditions are impermanent, 
their nature is to rise and fall; 
having arisen, they cease; 
their stilling is true bliss.’” 
2. The Garden of Delight )Delight ^n12 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Your children bring you delight! 
Your cattle also bring you delight! 
For attachments are a man’s delight; 
without attachments there’s no delight.” 
“Your children bring you sorrow. 
Your cattle also bring you sorrow. 
For attachments are a man’s sorrow; 
without attachments there are no sorrows.” 
2. The Garden of Delight )There’s Nothing Like a Child ^n13 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“There’s no love like that for a child, 
no wealth equal to cattle, 
no light like that of the sun, 
and of waters the ocean is paramount.” 
“There’s no love like that for oneself, 
no wealth equal to grain, 
no light like that of wisdom, 
and of waters the rain is paramount.” 
2. The Garden of Delight )Aristocrats ^n14 “An aristocrat is the best of bipeds, 
an ox is the best of quadrupeds, 
a maiden is the best of wives, 
and a first-born the best of sons.” 
“A Buddha is the best of bipeds, 
a thoroughbred, the best of quadrupeds, 
a good listener is the best of wives, 
and the best of sons is loyal.” 
2. The Garden of Delight )Whispering ^n15 “In the still of high noon, 
when the birds have settled down, 
the formidable jungle whispers to itself: 
that seems so scary to me!” 
“In the still of high noon, 
when the birds have settled down, 
the formidable jungle whispers to itself: 
that seems so delightful to me!” 
2. The Garden of Delight )Sleepiness and Sloth ^n16 “Sleepiness, sloth, and yawning, 
discontent, and grogginess after eating: 
because of this the noble path 
doesn’t shine for creatures here.” 
“Sleepiness, sloth, and yawning, 
discontent, and grogginess after eating: 
when this is energetically fended off, 
the noble path is purified.” 
2. The Garden of Delight )Hard to Do ^n17 “Hard to do, hard to endure, 
is the ascetic life for the inept, 
for it has many narrow passes 
where the fool founders.” 
“How many days could an ascetic live 
without controlling the mind? 
They’d founder with each step, 
under the sway of thoughts. 
A mendicant should collect their thoughts 
as a tortoise draws its limbs into its shell. 
Independent, not disturbing others, 
quenched: they wouldn’t blame anyone.” 
2. The Garden of Delight )Conscience ^n18 “Can a person constrained by conscience 
be found in the world? 
Who shies away from blame, 
like a fine horse from the whip?” 
“Few are those constrained by conscience, 
who live always mindful. 
Having reached the end of suffering, 
they live smoothly in the rough.” 
2. The Garden of Delight )Little Hut ^n19 “Don’t you have a little hut? 
Don’t you have a little nest? 
Don’t you have any networks? 
Aren’t you free of shackles?” 
“Indeed I have no little hut. 
Indeed I have no little nest. 
Indeed I have no networks. 
Indeed I’m free from shackles.” 
“What do you think I call a little hut? 
What do I call a little nest? 
What do you think I call a network? 
And what do I call a shackle?” 
“You call a mother a little hut; 
and a wife a little nest. 
You call children a network, 
and you tell me craving’s a shackle.” 
“It’s good you have no little hut! 
It’s good you have no little nest! 
It’s good you have no networks! 
And good that you’re free from shackles.” 
2. The Garden of Delight )With Samiddhi ^n20 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery. 
Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe. 
When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself. 
Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, went up to Samiddhi, and, standing in the air, addressed him in verse: 
“Mendicant, you seek alms before you eat; 
you wouldn’t seek alms after eating. 
But you should eat first, then seek alms: 
don’t let the time pass you by.” 
“I actually don’t know the time; 
it’s hidden and unseen. 
That’s why I seek alms before eating, 
so that the time may not pass me by!” 
Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Samiddhi, 
“You’ve gone forth while young, mendicant. You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures. 
Enjoy human sensual pleasures! 
Don’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.” 
“I’m not, good sir; 
I’m giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present. 
For the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks. 
But this teaching is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.” 
“But in what way, mendicant, has the Buddha said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks? 
And how is this teaching apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves?” 
“I’m junior, good sir, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. 
I’m not able to explain this in detail. 
But the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monatery. 
You should go to him and ask about this matter. 
And you should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” 
“It’s not easy for us to approach the Buddha, as he is surrounded by other illustrious deities. 
If you go to the Buddha and ask him about this matter, we’ll come along and listen to the teaching.” 
“Yes, good sir,” Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added: 
































“Sir, if that deity spoke the truth, he’ll be close by.” 
When he had spoken, that deity said to Samiddhi, 
“Ask, mendicant, ask! For I have arrived.” 
Then the Buddha addressed the deity in verse: 
“Sentient beings who perceive the communicable, 
become established in the communicable. 
Not understanding the communicable, 
they fall under the yoke of Death. 
But having fully understood the communicable, 
they don’t identify as a communicator, 
for they have nothing 
by which they might be described. 
Tell me if you understand, spirit.” 
“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement. 
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” 
“If you think that ‘I’m equal, 
special, or worse’, you’ll get into arguments. 
Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations, 
you’ll have no thought ‘I’m equal or special’. 
Tell me if you understand, spirit.” 
“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement. 
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” 
“Judging is given up, conceit rejected; 
craving for name and form is cut off right here. 
They’ve cut the ties, untroubled, <j>with no need for hope. 
Though gods and humans search for them 
in this world and the world beyond,  <j>they never find them, 
not in heaven nor in any abode. 
Tell me if you understand, spirit.” 
“This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement: 
You should never do anything bad 
by speech or mind or body in all the world. 
Having given up sensual pleasures,  <j>mindful and aware, 
you shouldn’t keep doing  <j>what’s painful and pointless.” 








^cksn#s1c(3. A Sword )A Sword ^n21 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Like they’re struck by a sword, 
like their head was on fire, 
a mendicant, mindful, should go forth, 
to give up sensual desire.” 
“Like they’re struck by a sword, 
like their head was on fire, 
a mendicant, mindful, should go forth, 
to give up identity view.” 
3. A Sword )Impact ^n22 “It doesn’t impact a person who doesn’t impact others. 
It impacts a person because they impact others. 
That’s why it impacts one who impacts, 
who wrongs one who’s done no wrong.” 
“Whoever wrongs a man who’s done no wrong, 
a pure man who has not a blemish, 
the evil backfires on the fool, 
like fine dust thrown upwind.” 
3. A Sword )A Tangle ^n23 “Tangled within, tangled without: 
these people are tangled in tangles. 
I ask you this, Gotama: 
who can untangle this tangle?” 
“A wise person grounded in ethics, 
developing the mind and wisdom, 
a keen and alert mendicant—
they can untangle this tangle. 
Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance 
have faded away; 
the perfected ones with defilements ended—
they have untangled the tangle. 
And where name and form 
cease with nothing left over; 
as well as impingement and perception of form: 
it’s there that the tangle is cut.” 
3. A Sword )Shielding the Mind ^n24 “Whatever you’ve shielded the mind from 
can’t cause you suffering. 
So you should shield the mind from everything, 
then you’re freed from all suffering.” 
“You needn’t shield the mind from everything. 
When the mind is under control, 
you need only shield the mind 
from where the bad things come.” 
3. A Sword )A Perfected One ^n25 “When a mendicant is perfected, proficient, 
with defilements ended, bearing the final body: 
would they say, ‘I speak’, 
or even ‘they speak to me’?” 
“When a mendicant is perfected, proficient, 
with defilements ended, bearing the final body: 
they would say, ‘I speak’, 
and also ‘they speak to me’. 
Skillful, understanding the world’s conventions, 
they’d use these terms as no more than expressions.” 
“When a mendicant is perfected, proficient, 
with defilements ended, bearing the final body: 
is such a mendicant drawing close to conceit 
if they’d say, ‘I speak’, 
or even ‘they speak to me’?” 
“Someone who has given up conceit has no ties, 
the ties of conceit are all dissipated. 
Though that clever person has transcended identity, 
they’d still say, ‘I speak’, 
and also ‘they speak to me’. 
Skillful, understanding the world’s conventions, 
they’d use these terms as no more than expressions.” 
3. A Sword )Lamps ^n26 “How many lamps are there 
that light up the world? 
We’ve come to ask the Buddha; 
how are we to understand this?” 
“There are four lamps in the world, 
a fifth is not found. 
The sun blazes by day, 
the moon glows at night, 
while a fire lights up both 
by day and by night. 
But a Buddha is the best of lights: 
this is the supreme radiance.” 
3. A Sword )Streams ^n27 “From where do streams turn back? 
Where does the cycle spin no more? 
Where do name and form 
cease with nothing left over?” 
“Where water and earth, 
fire and air find no footing—
from there the streams turn back; 
there the cycle spins no more; 
and there it is that name and form 
cease with nothing left over.” 
3. A Sword )Affluent ^n28 “The affluent and the wealthy, 
even the aristocrats who rule the land, 
are jealous of each other, 
insatiable in sensual pleasures. 
Among those of such an avid nature, 
flowing along the stream of lives, 
who here has given up craving? 
Who in the world is not avid?” 
“Having given up their home, their child, their cattle, 
and all that they love, they went forth. 
Having given up desire and hate, 
having dispelled ignorance, 
the perfected ones with defilements ended—
they in the world are not avid.” 
3. A Sword )Four Wheels ^n29 “Four are its wheels, and nine its doors; 
it’s stuffed full, bound with greed, 
and born from a bog. 
Great hero, how am I supposed to live like this?” 
“Having cut the strap and harness—
the wicked desire and greed—
and having plucked out craving, root and all: 
that’s how you’re supposed to live like this.” 
3. A Sword )Antelope Calves ^n30 “O hero so lean, with antelope calves, 
not greedy, eating little, 
an elephant, wandering alone like a lion, 
you’re not concerned for sensual pleasures. 
We’ve come to ask a question: 
How is one released from all suffering?” 
“The world has five kinds of sensual stimulation, 
and the mind is said to be the sixth. 
When you’ve discarded desire for these, 
you’re released from all suffering.” 








^cksn#s1d(4. The Satullapa Group )Virtuous ^n31 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
things get better, not worse.” 
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
wisdom is gained—but not from anyone else.” 
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
you grieve not among the grieving.” 
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
you shine among your relatives.” 
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
sentient beings go to a good place.” 
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
sentient beings live happily.” 
Then another deity said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, who has spoken well?” 
“You’ve all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also: 
Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
you’re released from all suffering.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then those deities, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before vanishing right there. 
4. The Satullapa Group )Stinginess ^n32 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Because of stinginess and negligence 
a gift is not given. 
Wanting merit, 
a smart person would give.” 
Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“When a miser fails to give because of fear, 
the very thing they’re afraid of comes to pass. 
The hunger and thirst 
that a miser fears 
hurt the fool 
in this world and the next. 
So you should dispel stinginess, 
overcoming that stain, and give a gift. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.” 
Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Among the dead they do not die, 
those who, like fellow travelers on the road, 
are happy to provide, though they have but little. 
This is an eternal truth. 
Some who have little are happy to provide, 
while some who have much don’t wish to give. 
An offering given from little 
is multiplied a thousand times.” 
Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Giving what’s hard to give, 
doing what’s hard to do; 
the wicked don’t act like this, 
for the teaching of the good is hard to follow. 
That’s why the virtuous and the wicked 
have different destinations after leaving this place. 
The wicked go to hell, 
while the virtuous are bound for heaven.” 
Then another deity said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, who has spoken well?” 
“You’ve all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also: 
A hundred thousand people  <j>making a thousand sacrifices 
isn’t worth a fraction 
of one who lives rightly, wandering for gleanings, 
or one who supports their partner  <j>from what little they have.” 
Then another deity addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Why doesn’t that sacrifice of theirs, so abundant and magnificent, 
equal the value of a moral person’s gift? 
How is it that a hundred thousand people  <j>making a thousand sacrifices 
isn’t worth a fraction  <j>of what’s offered by such a person?” 
“Some give based on immorality—
after injuring, killing, and tormenting. 
Such an offering—tearful, violent—
in no way equals the value of a moral person’s gift. 
That’s how it is that a hundred thousand people  <j>making a thousand sacrifices 
isn’t worth a fraction  <j>of what’s offered by such a person.” 
4. The Satullapa Group )Good ^n33 At Sāvatthī. 
Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
Standing to one side, one deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Good, sir, is giving! 
Because of stinginess and negligence 
a gift is not given. 
Wanting merit, 
a smart person would give.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Good, sir, is giving! 
Even when one has little, giving is good. 
Some who have little are happy to provide, 
while some who have much don’t wish to give. 
An offering given from little 
is multiplied a thousand times.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Good, sir, is giving! 
Even when one has little, giving is good. 
And it’s also good to give out of faith. 
Giving and warfare are similar, they say, 
for even a few of the good may conquer the many. 
If a faithful person gives even a little, 
it still brings them happiness in the hereafter.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Good, sir, is giving! 
Even when one has little, giving is good. 
And it’s also good to give out of faith. 
And it’s also good to give legitimate wealth. 
A man who gives legitimate wealth, 
earned by his efforts and initiative, 
has passed over Yama’s Vetaraṇi River; 
that mortal arrives at celestial fields.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Good, sir, is giving! 
Even when one has little, giving is good. 
And it’s also good to give out of faith. 
And it’s also good to give legitimate wealth. 
And it’s also good to give intelligently. 
The Holy One praises giving intelligently 
to those worthy of offerings here  <j>in the world of the living. 
What’s given to these is very fruitful, 
like seeds sown in a fertile field.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Good, sir, is giving! 
Even when one has little, giving is good. 
And it’s also good to give out of faith. 
And it’s also good to give legitimate wealth. 
And it’s also good to give intelligently. 
And it’s also good to be restrained  <j>when it comes to living creatures. 
One who lives without harming any living being 
never does bad because of others’ blame; 
for in that case they praise the coward, not the brave; 
and the virtuous never do bad out of fear.” 
Then another deity said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, who has spoken well?” 
“You’ve all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also: 
It’s true that giving is praised in many ways 
but the path of the teaching is better than giving, 
for in days old and older still, 
the wise and virtuous even attained extinction.” 
4. The Satullapa Group )There Are None ^n34 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Among humans there are no sensual pleasures  <j>that are permanent. 
Here there are sensuous things, bound to which, 
drunk on which, there’s no coming back. 
That person doesn’t return here  <j>from Death’s domain.” 
“Misery is born of desire; suffering is born of desire; 
when desire is removed, misery is removed; 
when misery is removed, suffering is removed.” 
“The world’s pretty things aren’t sensual pleasures. 
Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure. 
The world’s pretty things stay just as they are, 
but a wise one removes desire for them. 
Give up anger, get rid of conceit, 
and get past all the fetters. 
Sufferings don’t torment the one who has nothing, 
not clinging to name and form. 
Judging’s given up, conceit rejected; 
craving for name and form is cut off right here. 
They’ve cut the ties, untroubled,  <j>with no need for hope. 
Though gods and humans search for them 
in this world and the world beyond,  <j>they never find them, 
not in heaven nor in any abode.” 
“If neither gods nor humans see one freed in this way,” 
said Venerable Mogharājā, 
“in this world or the world beyond, 
are those who revere that supreme person, 
who lives for the good of mankind,  <j>also worthy of praise?” 
“The mendicants who revere one freed in this way,” 
said the Buddha, 
“are also worthy of praise, Mogharājā. 
But having understood the teaching  <j>and given up doubt, 
those mendicants can escape their chains.” 
4. The Satullapa Group )Disdain ^n35 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Disdainful Group, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, and stood in the air. 
Standing in the air, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Someone who pretends 
to be other than they really are, 
is like a cheating gambler 
who enjoys what was gained by theft. 
You should only say what you would do; 
you shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do. 
The wise will recognize 
one who talks without doing.” 
“Not just by speaking, 
nor solely by listening, 
are you able to progress 
on this hard path, 
by which wise ones practicing absorption 
are released from Māra’s bonds. 
The wise certainly don’t act like that, 
for they understand the way of the world. 
The wise are extinguished by understanding, 
they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.” 
Then those deities landed on the ground, bowed with their heads at the Buddha’s feet and said, 
“We have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of us to imagine we could attack the Buddha! 
Please, sir, accept our mistake for what it is, so we will restrain ourselves in future.” 
At that, the Buddha smiled. 
Then those deities, becoming even more disdainful, flew up in the air. 
One deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“If you don’t give your pardon 
when a mistake is confessed, 
with hidden anger and heavy hate, 
you’re stuck in your enmity.” 
“If no mistake is found, 
if no-one’s gone astray, 
and enmities are settled, 
then who could have been unskillful?” 
“Who makes no mistakes? 
Who doesn’t go astray? 
Who doesn’t fall into confusion? 
Who is the wise one that’s ever mindful?” 
“The Realized One, the Buddha, 
compassionate for all beings: 
that’s who makes no mistakes, 
and that’s who doesn’t go astray. 
He doesn’t fall into confusion, 
for he’s the wise one, ever mindful. 
If you don’t give your pardon 
when a mistake is confessed, 
with hidden anger and heavy hate, 
you’re stuck in your enmity. 
I don’t approve of such enmity, 
and so I pardon your mistake.” 
4. The Satullapa Group )Faith ^n36 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Faith is a person’s partner. 
If faithlessness doesn’t linger, 
fame and renown are theirs, 
and when they discard this corpse they go to heaven.” 
Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Give up anger, get rid of conceit, 
and get past all the fetters. 
Chains don’t torment one who has nothing, 
not clinging to name and form.” 
“Fools and half-wits 
devote themselves to negligence. 
But the wise protect diligence 
as their best treasure. 
Don’t devote yourself to negligence, 
or delight in sexual intimacy. 
For if you’re diligent and practice absorption, 
you’ll attain ultimate happiness.” 
4. The Satullapa Group )The Congregation ^n37 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants, all of whom were perfected ones. 
And most of the deities from ten solar systems had gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants. 
Then four deities of the Pure Abodes, aware of what was happening, thought: 


“Why don’t we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his presence?” 
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side. 
Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“There’s a great congregation in the woods, 
where hosts of gods have assembled. 
We’ve come to this righteous congregation 
to see the invincible Saṅgha!” 
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The mendicants there have immersion, 
they’ve straightened their own minds. 
Like a charioteer holding the reins, 
the astute ones protect their senses.” 
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“They snapped the post and snapped the bar, 
unstirred, they tore out the boundary post. 
They live pure and immaculate, 
the young giants tamed by the seer.” 
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge 
won’t go to a plane of loss. 
After giving up this human body, 
they swell the hosts of gods.” 
4. The Satullapa Group )A Splinter ^n38 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi deer park. 
Now at that time the Buddha’s foot had been cut by a splinter. 
The Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. 
But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. 
And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware. 
Then, late at night, seven hundred glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Maddakucchi, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
Standing to one side, one deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The ascetic Gotama is such an elephant, sir! 
And as an elephant, he endures painful physical feelings that have come up—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable—unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The ascetic Gotama is such a lion, sir! 
And as a lion, he endures painful physical feelings … unbothered.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The ascetic Gotama is such a thoroughbred, sir! 
And as a thoroughbred, he endures painful physical feelings … unbothered.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The ascetic Gotama is such a chief bull, sir! 
And as a chief bull, he endures painful physical feelings … unbothered.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The ascetic Gotama is such a behemoth, sir! 
And as a behemoth, he endures painful physical feelings … unbothered.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The ascetic Gotama is truly tamed, sir! 
And as someone tamed, he endures painful physical feelings … unbothered.” 
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“See, his immersion is so well developed, and his mind is so well freed—not leaning forward or pulling back, and not held in place by forceful suppression. 
If anyone imagines that they can overcome such an elephant of a man, a lion of a man, a thoroughbred of a man, a chief bull of a man, a behemoth of a man, a tamed man—what is that but a failure to see?” 
“Learned in the five Vedas, brahmins practice 
mortification for a full century. 
But their minds are not properly freed, 
for those of base character don’t cross to the far shore. 
Seized by craving,  <j>attached to precepts and observances, 
they practice rough mortification for a hundred years. 
But their minds are not properly freed, 
for those of base character don’t cross to the far shore. 
Someone who’s fond of conceit can’t be tamed, 
and someone without immersion can’t be a sage. 
Living negligent alone in the wilderness, 
they can’t pass beyond Death’s domain.” 
“Having given up conceit, serene within oneself, 
with a healthy heart, everywhere free; 
living diligent alone in the wilderness, 
they pass beyond Death’s domain.” 
4. The Satullapa Group )With Pajjunna’s Daughter (1st) ^n39 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then, late at night, the beautiful Kokanadā, Pajjunna’s daughter, lighting up the entire Great Wood, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Staying in the woods of Vesālī 
is the Buddha, best of beings. 
Kokanadā am I who worships him, 
Kokanadā, Pajjuna’s daughter. 
Previously I had only heard 
the teaching realized by the seer. 
But now I know it as a witness 
while the sage, the Holy One teaches. 
There are unintelligent people who go about 
denouncing the teaching of the noble ones. 
They fall into the terrible Hell of Screams 
where they suffer long. 
There are those who have found  <j>acceptance and peace 
in the teaching of the noble ones. 
After giving up this human body, 
they swell the hosts of gods.” 
4. The Satullapa Group )With Pajjunna’s Daughter (2nd) ^n40 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then, late at night, the beautiful Kokanadā the Younger, Pajjunna’s daughter, lighting up the entire Great Wood, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Kokanadā, Pajjunna’s daughter, came here, 
beautiful as a flash of lightning. 
Revering the Buddha and the teaching, 
she spoke these verses full of meaning. 
The teaching is such that 
I could analyze it in many different ways. 
However, I will state the meaning in brief 
as far as I have learned it by heart. 
You should never do anything bad 
by speech or mind or body in all the world. 
Having given up sensual pleasures,  <j>mindful and aware, 
you shouldn’t keep doing  <j>what’s painful and pointless.” 






^cksn#s1e(5. On Fire )On Fire ^n41 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“When your house is on fire, 
you rescue the pot 
that’s useful, 
not the one that’s burnt. 
And as the world is on fire 
with old age and death, 
you should rescue by giving, 
for what’s given is rescued. 
What’s given has happiness as its fruit, 
but not what isn’t given. 
Bandits take it, or rulers, 
it’s consumed by fire, or lost. 
Then in the end this corpse is cast off, 
along with all your possessions. 
Knowing this, a clever person 
would enjoy what they have and also give it away. 
After giving and using according to their means, 
blameless, they go to a heavenly place.” 
5. On Fire )Giving What? ^n42 “Giving what do you give strength? 
Giving what do you give beauty? 
Giving what do you give happiness? 
Giving what do you give vision? 
And who is the giver of all? 
Please answer my question.” 
“Giving food you give strength. 
Giving clothes you give beauty. 
Giving a vehicle you give happiness. 
Giving a lamp you give vision. 
And the giver of all 
is the one who gives a residence. 
But a person who teaches the Dhamma 
gives the gift of the Deathless.” 
5. On Fire )Food ^n43 “Both gods and humans 
enjoy their food. 
So what’s the name of the spirit 
who doesn’t like food?” 
“Those who give with faith 
and a clear and confident heart, 
partake of food 
in this world and the next. 
So you should dispel stinginess, 
overcoming that stain, and give a gift. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.” 
5. On Fire )One Root ^n44 “One is the root, two are the whirlpools, 
three are the stains, five the spreads, 
twelve the ocean’s whirlpools: 
such is the abyss crossed over by the hermit.” 
5. On Fire )Peerless ^n45 Behold him of peerless name <j>who sees the subtle meaning, 
giver of wisdom, <j>unattached to the realm of sensuality: 
the all-knower, so very intelligent, 
the great hermit treading the noble road.” 
5. On Fire )Nymphs ^n46 “It’s resounding with a group of nymphs, 
but haunted by a gang of goblins! 
This grove is called ‘Delusion’. 
How am I supposed to live like this?” 
“That path is called ‘the straight way’, 
and it’s headed for the place called ‘fearless’. 
The chariot is called ‘unswerving’, 
fitted with wheels of skillful thoughts. 
Conscience is its bench-back, 
mindfulness its upholstery. 
I say the teaching is the driver, 
with right view running out in front. 
Any woman or man 
who has such a vehicle, 
by means of this vehicle 
has drawn near to extinguishment.” 
5. On Fire )Planters ^n47 “Whose merit always grows 
by day and by night? 
Firm in principle, accomplished in conduct, 
who is going to heaven?” 
“Planters of parks or groves, 
those who build a bridge, 
a drinking place and well, 
and those who give a residence. 
Their merit always grows 
by day and by night. 
Firm in principle, accomplished in conduct, 
they are going to heaven.” 
5. On Fire )Jeta’s Grove ^n48 “This is indeed that Jeta’s Grove, 
frequented by the Saṅgha of hermits, 
where the King of Dhamma stayed: 
it brings me joy! 
Deeds, knowledge, and principle; 
ethical conduct, an excellent livelihood; 
by these are mortals purified, 
not by clan or wealth. 
That’s why an astute person, 
seeing what’s good for themselves, 
would examine the teaching properly, 
and thus be purified in it. 
Sāriputta has true wisdom, 
ethics, and also peace. 
Any mendicant who has crossed over 
can at best equal him.” 
5. On Fire )Stingy ^n49 “Those folk in the world who are stingy, 
miserly and abusive, 
setting up obstacles 
for others who give. 
What kind of result do they reap? 
What kind of future life? 
We’ve come to ask the Buddha; 
how are we to understand this?” 
“Those folk in the world who are stingy, 
miserly and abusive, 
setting up obstacles 
for others who give: 
they’re reborn in hell, 
the animal realm, or Yama’s world. 
If they return to the human state, 
they’re born in a poor family, 
where clothes, food, pleasure, and play 
are hard to find. 
They don’t even get 
what they expect from others. 
This is the result in the present life, 
and in the next, a bad destination.” 
“We get what you’re saying, 
and ask another question, Gotama. 
What about those who’ve gained the human state, 
who are bountiful and rid of stinginess, 
confident in the Buddha and the teaching, 
with keen respect for the Saṅgha? 
What kind of result do they reap? 
What kind of future life? 
We’ve come to ask the Buddha; 
how are we to understand this?” 
“Those who’ve gained the human state 
who are bountiful and rid of stinginess, 
confident in the Buddha and the teaching, 
with keen respect for the Saṅgha: 
they illuminate the heavens 
wherever they’re reborn. 
If they return to the human state, 
they’re reborn in a rich family, 
where clothes, food, pleasure, and play 
are easy to find. 
They rejoice like those 
who control the possessions of others. 
This is the result in the present life, 
and in the next, a good destination.” 
5. On Fire )With Ghaṭīkāra ^n50 “Seven mendicants reborn in Aviha 
have been freed. 
With the complete ending of greed and hate, 
they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.” 
“Who are those who’ve crossed the bog, 
Death’s domain so hard to pass? 
Who, after leaving behind the human body, 
have risen above celestial yokes?” 
“Upaka and Palagaṇḍa, 
and Pukkusāti, these three; 
Bhaddiya and Bhaddadeva, 
and Bāhudantī and Piṅgiya. 
They, after leaving behind the human body, 
have risen above celestial yokes.” 
“You speak well of them, 
who have let go the snares of Māra. 
Whose teaching did they understand 
to cut the bonds of rebirth?” 
“None other than the Blessed One! 
None other than your instruction! 
It was your teaching that they understood 
to cut the bonds of rebirth. 
Where name and form 
cease with nothing left over; 
understanding this teaching, 
they cut the bonds of rebirth.” 
“The words you say are deep, 
hard to understand, so very hard to wake up to. 
Whose teaching did you understand 
that you can say such things?” 
“In the past I was a potter 
in Vebhaliṅga called Ghaṭīkāra. 
I took care of my parents 
as a lay follower of Buddha Kassapa. 
I refrained from sexual intercourse, 
I was celibate, spiritual. 
We lived in the same village; 
in the past I was your friend. 
I am the one who understands 
that these seven mendicants have been freed. 
With the complete ending of greed and hate, 
they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.” 
“That’s exactly how it was, 
just as you say, Bhaggava. 
In the past you were a potter 
in Vebhaliṅga called Ghaṭīkāra. 
You took care of your parents 
as a lay follower of Buddha Kassapa. 
You refrained from sexual intercourse, 
you were celibate, spiritual. 
We lived in the same village; 
in the past you were my friend.” 
“That’s how it was 
when those friends of old met again. 
Both of them are evolved, 
and bear their final body.” 






^cksn#s1f(6. Old Age )Old Age ^n51 “What’s still good in old age?

Who’s your friend at home? 
Who’s your friend in need? 
Who’s your friend in the next life?” 
“A caravan is your friend abroad. 
Mother is your friend at home. 
A comrade in a time of need 
is a friend time and again. 
But the good deeds you’ve done yourself—
that’s your friend in the next life.” 
6. Old Age )Grounds ^n54 “What is the ground of human beings? 
What is the best companion here? 
By what do the creatures who live off the earth

A wife is the best companion. 
The creatures who live off the earth 
sustain their life by rain.”

Their mind is what runs about. 
A sentient being enters transmigration. 
Suffering is their greatest fear.”

A sentient being enters transmigration.

^cksn#s1h(8. Incinerated )Incinerated ^n71 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease? 
When what is incinerated is there no sorrow? 
What’s the one thing, Gotama, 
whose killing you approve?” 
“When anger’s incinerated you sleep at ease.

O deity, anger has a poisonous root 
and a honey tip.

for when it’s incinerated there is no sorrow.”

laziness and negligence, 
lack of initiative and lack of restraint, 
sleepiness and sloth. 
You should completely get rid of these holes!” 
8. Incinerated )Authority ^n77 “What is authority in the world? 
What’s the best of valuables? 
What in the world is a rusty sword? 
Who is a plague on the world? 
Who gets arrested when they take things away? 
And who is loved when they take things away? 
And who is approved by the astute 
when they come again and again?” 
“Power is authority in the world. 
A woman is the best of valuables. 
Anger in the world is a rusty sword. 
A bandit is a plague on the world. 
A bandit gets arrested when they take things away. 
And an ascetic is loved when they take things away. 
An ascetic is approved by the astute 
when they come again and again.” 
8. Incinerated )Desire ^n78 “What should one who desires the good <j>not give away? 
What should a mortal not reject? 
What should be let out when it’s good, 
but not when it’s bad?” 
“A man shouldn’t give away himself. 
He shouldn’t reject himself. 
Speech should be let out when it’s good, 
but not when it’s bad.” 
8. Incinerated )Provisions ^n79 “How should provisions be tied up? 
What’s the lair of wealth? 
What drags a person around? 
What in the world is hard to give up? 
What are many beings tied up with, 
like birds in a snare?” 
“Provisions should be tied up with faith. 
Glory is the lair of wealth. 
Desire drags a person around. 
Desire in the world is hard to give up. 
Many beings are tied up with desire, 
like birds in a snare.” 
8. Incinerated )Lamp ^n80 “What’s the lamp for the world? 
What in the world is wakeful? 
Who are one’s work colleagues? 
What is one’s walk of life? 
What nurtures the idle and the tireless, 
like a mother her child? 
By what do the creatures who live off the earth 
sustain their life?” 
“Wisdom is the lamp for the world. 
Mindfulness in the world is wakeful. 
Cattle are one’s work colleagues, 
and the furrow is one’s walk of life. 
Rain nurtures the idle and the tireless, 
like a mother her child. 
The creatures who live on the earth 
sustain their life by rain.” 
8. Incinerated )Without Conflict ^n81 “Who in the world has no conflict? 
Whose life is not lost? 
Who here completely understands desire? 
Who always lives as their own master? 
To whom do mother, father, and brothers 
bow when they’re established? 
Who here, though of low birth, 
is bowed to even by aristocrats?” 
“Ascetics have no conflict in the world. 
The life of ascetics is not lost. 
Ascetics completely understand desire. 
Ascetics always live as their own master. 
Mother, father, and brothers 
bow to ascetics when they’re established. 
Even though an ascetic is of low birth, 
they’re bowed to even by aristocrats.” 






The Linked Discourses on Deities are complete. 
^ck#s2(Gods)^cksn#s2a(1. Chapter One )With Kassapa (1st) ^n82 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Kassapa, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“The Buddha has revealed the mendicant, but not his instructions to a mendicant.” 
“Well then, Kassapa, clarify this matter yourself.” 
“They should train in following good advice, 
in attending closely to ascetics, 
in sitting alone in hidden places, 
and in calming the mind.” 
That’s what the god Kassapa said, 
and the teacher approved. 
Then Kassapa, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. 
Chapter One )With Kassapa (2nd) ^n83 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, the god Kassapa recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Suppose a mendicant is a meditator, freed in mind. 
If they want to reach the heart’s peace, 
having known the arising and passing of the world, 
healthy-minded, independent, that is their reward.” 
Chapter One )With Māgha ^n84 At Sāvatthī. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Māgha, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease? 
When what is incinerated is there no sorrow? 
What is the one thing 
whose killing you approve?” 
“When anger’s incinerated you sleep at ease. 
When anger’s incinerated there is no sorrow. 
Vatrabhū, anger has a poisonous root, 
and a honey tip. 
The noble ones praise the slaying of anger, 
for when it’s incinerated there is no sorrow.” 
Chapter One )With Māghadha ^n85 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, the god Māgadha addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“How many lamps are there 
that light up the world? 
We’ve come to ask the Buddha; 
how are we to understand this?” 
“There are four lamps in the world, 
a fifth is not found. 
The sun blazes by day, 
the moon glows at night, 
while a fire lights up both 
by day and by night. 
But a Buddha is the best of lights: 
this is the supreme radiance.” 
Chapter One )With Dāmali ^n86 At Sāvatthī. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Dāmali, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“This is what should be done by a brahmin: 
unrelenting striving. 
Then, with the giving up of sensual pleasures, 
they won’t hope to be reborn.” 
“The brahmin has nothing left to do,” 
said the Buddha to Dāmali, 
“for they’ve completed their task. 
So long as a person fails to gain a footing in the river, 
they strive with every limb. 
But someone who has gained a footing <j>and stands on dry land 
need not strive, <j>for they have reached the far shore. 
Dāmali, this is a simile for the brahmin, 
alert, a meditator who has ended defilements. 
Since they’ve reached the end of rebirth and death, 
they need not strive, <j>for they have reached the far shore.” 
Chapter One )With Kāmada ^n87 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, the god Kāmada said to the Buddha, 
“It’s too hard, Blessed One! It’s just too hard!” 
“They do it even though it’s hard,” 
said the Buddha to Kāmada, 
“the stable trainees with ethics, and immersion. 
For one who has entered the homeless life, 
contentment brings happiness.” 
“Such contentment, Blessed One, is hard to find.” 
“They find it even though it’s hard,” 
said the Buddha to Kāmada, 
“those who love peace of mind; 
whose minds love to meditate 
day and night.” 
“But it’s hard, Blessed One, to immerse this mind in samādhi.” 
“They become immersed in samādhi <j>even though it’s hard,” 
said the Buddha to Kāmada, 
“those who love calming the faculties. 
Having cut through the net of Death, 
the noble ones, Kāmada, go on their way.” 
“But this path, Blessed One, is rough and hard to travel.” 
“Though it’s rough, hard to travel, 
the noble ones, Kāmada, go on their way. 
The ignoble fall headfirst 
on a rough path. 
But the path of the noble ones is smooth, 
for the noble ones are smooth amid the rough.” 
Chapter One )With Pañcālacaṇḍa ^n88 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, the god Pañcālacaṇḍa recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The opening amid confinement 
was discovered by the Buddha of vast intelligence, 
who woke up to absorption, 
the sage, the solitary bull.” 
“Even amid confinement they discover,” 
said the Buddha to Pañcālacaṇḍa, 
“the principle for attaining extinguishment. 
Those who have acquired mindfulness 
are perfectly serene in samādhi.” 
Chapter One )With Tāyana ^n89 At Sāvatthī. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Tāyana, formerly a religious founder, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Strive and cut the stream! 
Dispel sensual pleasures, brahmin. 
A sage who doesn’t give up sensual pleasures 
is not reborn in a unified state. 
If one is to do what should be done, 
one should staunchly strive. 
For the life gone forth when laxly led 
just stirs up dust all the more. 
A bad deed is better left undone, 
for it will plague you later on. 
A good deed is better done, 
one that does not plague you. 
When kusa grass is wrongly grasped 
it only cuts the hand. 
So too, the ascetic life, when wrongly taken, 
drags you to hell. 
Any lax act, 
any corrupt observance, 
or suspicious spiritual life, 
is not very fruitful.” 
That’s what the god Tāyana said. 
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. 
Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. 
“Mendicants, tonight, the glorious god Tāyana, formerly a religious founder, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited these verses in my presence.” The Buddha repeated the verses in full, adding: 




















“That’s what the god Tāyana said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there. 
Mendicants, learn the verses of Tāyana! 
Memorize the verses of Tāyana! 
Remember the verses of Tāyana! 
These verses are beneficial and relate to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.” 
Chapter One )The Moon ^n90 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the Moon God had been seized by Rāhu, lord of demons. 
Then the Moon God, recollecting the Buddha, at that time recited this verse: 
“Homage to you, Buddha, hero! 
You’re free in every way. 
I’ve wandered into confinement: 
be my refuge!” 
Then the Buddha addressed Rāhu in verse concerning the Moon God: 
“The Moon God has gone for refuge 
to the Realized One, the perfected one. 
The Buddhas have compassion for the world—
so Rāhu, release the Moon!” 
Then Rāhu, having released the Moon, rushed to see Vepacitti, lord of demons and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. 
Vepacitti addressed him in verse: 
“Why the rush? 
Rāhu, you released the Moon 
and came here looking like you’re in shock: 
why do you stand there so scared?” 
“My head would have exploded in seven pieces, 
I would have found no happiness in life, 
if, when enchanted by the Buddha’s spell, 
I had not released the Moon.” 
Chapter One )The Sun ^n91 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the Sun God had been seized by Rāhu, lord of demons. 
Then the Sun God, recollecting the Buddha, at that time recited this verse: 
“Homage to you, Buddha, hero! 
You’re everywhere free. 
I’ve wandered into confinement: 
be my refuge!” 
Then the Buddha addressed Rāhu in verse concerning the Sun God: 
“The Sun God has gone for refuge 
to the Realized One, the perfected one. 
The Buddhas have compassion for the world—
so Rāhu, release the Sun! 
He is a beacon in the darkness, 
the blazing sun, circle of magnificent flame. 
Rāhu, do not swallow him as he traverses the sky. 
Rāhu, release my offspring, the Sun!” 
Then Rāhu, having released the Sun, rushed to see Vepacitti, lord of demons and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. 
Vepacitti addressed him in verse: 
“Why the rush? 
Rāhu, you released the Sun 
and came here looking like you’re in shock: 
why do you stand there so scared?” 
“My head would have exploded in seven pieces, 
I would have found no joy in life, 
if, when enchanted by the Buddha’s spell, 
I had not released the Sun.” 






^cksn#s2b(2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Candimasa ^n92 At Sāvatthī. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Candimasa, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Like deer in a mosquito-free marsh, 
they will reach a safe place 
having entered the absorptions, 
unified, alert, and mindful.” 
“Like fish when the net is cut, 
they will reach the far shore 
having entered the absorptions, 
diligent, with vices discarded.” 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Vishnu ^n93 Standing to one side, the god Vishnu recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Happy are the children of Manu 
who pay homage to the Holy One! 
They apply themselves to Gotama’s instructions, 
diligently training.” 
“Those who practice absorption <j>in accord with the training”, 
said the Buddha to Vishnu, 
“in the way of teaching I’ve proclaimed, 
they’re in time to be diligent; 
they won’t fall under the sway of Death.” 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Dīghalaṭṭhi ^n94 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Dīghalaṭṭhi, lighting up the entire Bamboo Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Suppose a mendicant is a meditator, freed in mind. 
If they want to reach the heart’s peace, 
having known the arising and passing of the world, 
healthy-minded, independent, that is their reward.” 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Nandana ^n95 Standing to one side, the god Nandana addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“I ask you, Gotama, whose wisdom is vast, 
the Blessed One <j>of unhindered knowledge and vision. 
What kind of person do they call ethical? 
What kind of person do they call wise? 
What kind of person lives on <j>after transcending suffering? 
What kind of person is worshipped by the deities?” 
“A person who is ethical, wise, evolved, 
becomes serene, loving absorption, mindful, 
who’s gotten rid of and given up all sorrows, 
with defilements ended, they bear their final body. 
That’s the kind of person they call ethical. 
That’s the kind of person they call wise. 
That kind of person lives on <j>after transcending suffering. 
That kind of person is worshipped by the deities.” 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Candana ^n96 Standing to one side, the god Candana addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Who here crosses the flood, 
tireless all day and night? 
Who, not standing and unsupported, 
does not sink in the deep?” 
“Someone who is always endowed with ethics, 
wise and serene, 
energetic and resolute, 
crosses the flood so hard to cross. 
Someone who desists from sensual perception, 
has moved past the fetter of form, 
and has finished with relishing and greed 
does not sink in the deep.” 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Vāsudatta ^n97 Standing to one side, the god Vāsudatta recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Like they’re struck by a sword, 
like their head was on fire, 
a mendicant should wander mindful, 
to give up sensual desire.” 
“Like they’re struck by a sword, 
like their head was on fire, 
a mendicant should wander mindful, 
to give up identity view.” 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Subrahmā ^n98 Standing to one side, the god Subrahmā addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“This mind is always anxious, 
this mind is always stressed 
about stresses that haven’t arisen 
and those that have. 
If there is a state free of anxiety, 
please answer my question.” 
“Not without understanding and fervor, 
not without restraining the sense faculties, 
not without letting go of everything, 
do I see safety for living creatures.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
The god vanished right there. 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Kakudha ^n99 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer park at the Añjana Wood. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Kakudha, lighting up the entire Añjana Wood, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“Do you delight, ascetic?” 
“What have I gained, sir?” 
“Well then, ascetic, do you sorrow?” 
“What have I lost, sir?” 
“Well then, ascetic, do you neither delight nor sorrow?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“I hope you’re untroubled, mendicant, 
I hope that delight isn’t found in you. 
I hope that discontent doesn’t 
overwhelm you as you sit alone.” 
“I’m genuinely untroubled, spirit, 
and no delight is found in me. 
And also discontent doesn’t 
overwhelm me as I sit alone.” 
“How are you untroubled, mendicant? 
How is delight not found in you? 
How does discontent not 
overwhelm you as you sit alone?” 
“Delight is born from misery, 
misery is born from delight; 
sir, you should know me as 
a mendicant free of delight and misery.” 
“After a long time I see 
a brahmin extinguished. 
A mendicant free of delight and misery, 
he has crossed over clinging to the world.” 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Uttara ^n100 At Rājagaha. 
Standing to one side, the god Uttara recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“This life, so very short, is led onward. 
There’s no shelter for one led on by old age. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
do good deeds that bring happiness.” 
“This life, so very short, is led onward. 
There’s no shelter for one led on by old age. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
a seeker of peace would drop the world’s bait.” 
2. With Anāthapiṇḍika )With Anāthapiṇḍika ^n101 Standing to one side, the god Anāthapiṇḍika recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“This is indeed that Jeta’s Grove, 
frequented by the Saṅgha of hermits, 
where the King of Dhamma stayed: 
it brings me joy! 
Deeds, knowledge, and principle; 
ethical conduct, an excellent livelihood; 
by these are mortals purified, 
not by clan or wealth. 
That’s why an astute person, 
seeing what’s good for themselves, 
would examine the teaching rationally, 
and thus be purified in it. 
Sāriputta has true wisdom, 
ethics, and also peace. 
Any mendicant who has gone beyond 
can at best equal him.” 
This is what the god Anāthapiṇḍika said. 
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. 
Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, tonight, a certain glorious god, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited these verses in my presence.” The Buddha then repeated the verses in full. 


















When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, that god must surely have been Anāthapiṇḍika. 
For the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was devoted to Venerable Sāriputta.” 
“Good, good, Ānanda. You’ve reached the logical conclusion, as far as logic goes. 
For that was indeed the god Anāthapiṇḍika.” 








^cksn#s2c(3. Various Sectarians )With Shiva ^n102 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Shiva, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
things get better, not worse. 
Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
wisdom is gained—but not from anyone else. 
Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
you grieve not among the grieving. 
Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
you shine among your relatives. 
Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
sentient beings go to a good place. 
Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
sentient beings live happily.” 
Then the Buddha replied to Shiva in verse: 
“Associate only with the virtuous! 
Try to get close to the virtuous! 
Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
you’re released from all suffering.” 
3. Various Sectarians )With Khema ^n103 Standing to one side, the god Khema recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Witless fools behave 
like their own worst enemies, 
doing wicked deeds 
that ripen as bitter fruit. 
It’s not good to do a deed 
that plagues you later on, 
for which you weep and wail, 
as its effect stays with you. 
It is good to do a deed 
that doesn’t plague you later on, 
that gladdens and cheers, 
as its effect stays with you.” 
“As a precaution, you should do 
what you know is for your own welfare. 
A thinker, a wise one would not proceed 
thinking like the cart driver. 
Suppose a cart driver leaves the highway, 
so even and well compacted. 
They enter upon a rough road, 
and fret when their axle breaks. 
So too, an idiot departs the good 
to follow what’s against the good. 
Fallen in the jaws of death, 
they fret like their axle’s broken.” 
3. Various Sectarians )With Serī ^n104 Standing to one side, the god Serī addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Both gods and humans 
enjoy their food. 
So what’s the name of the spirit 
who doesn’t like food?” 
“Those who give with faith 
and a clear and confident heart, 
partake of food 
in this world and the next. 
So you should dispel stinginess, 
overcoming that stain, and give a gift. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.” 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
how well said this was by Master Gotama.” He repeated the Buddha’s verses, and said: 








“Once upon a time, sir, I was a king named Serī, a giver, a donor, who praised giving. 
I gave gifts at the four gates to ascetics and brahmins, to paupers, vagrants, nomads, and beggars. 
Then the ladies of my harem approached me and said, 
‘Your Majesty gives gifts, but we don’t. 
Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’ 
Then it occurred to me, 
‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving. 
When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’ 
And so I gave the first gate to the ladies of my harem. 
There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled. 
Then my aristocrat vassals approached me and said, 
‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, but we don’t. 
Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’ 
Then it occurred to me, 
‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving. 
When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’ 
And so I gave the second gate to my aristocrat vassals. 
There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled. 
Then my troops approached me and said, 
‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, your aristocrat vassals give gifts, but we don’t. 
Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’ 
Then it occurred to me, 
‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving. 
When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’ 
And so I gave the third gate to my troops. 
There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled. 
Then my brahmins and householders approached me and said, 
‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, your aristocrat vassals give gifts, your troops give gifts, but we don’t. 
Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’ 
Then it occurred to me, 
‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving. 
When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’ 
And so I gave the fourth gate to my brahmins and householders. 
There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled. 
Then my men approached me and said, 
‘Now Your Majesty is not giving gifts at all!’ 
When they said this, I said to those men, 
‘So then, my men, send half of the revenue from the outer districts to the royal compound. Then give half right there to ascetics and brahmins, to paupers, vagrants, nomads, and beggars.’ 
Sir, for a long time I made so much merit and did so many skillful deeds. I never reached any limit so as to say 
‘there’s this much merit’ or ‘there’s this much result of merit’ or ‘for so long I’ll remain in heaven’. 
It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
how well said this was by Master Gotama: 
‘Those who give with faith 
and a clear and confident heart, 
partake of food 
in this world and the next. 
So you should dispel stinginess, 
overcoming that stain, and give a gift. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.’” 
3. Various Sectarians )With Ghaṭīkāra ^n105 Standing to one side, the god Ghaṭīkāra recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Seven mendicants reborn in Aviha 
have been freed. 
With the complete ending of greed and hate, 
they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.” 
“Who are those who’ve crossed the bog, 
Death’s domain so hard to pass? 
Who, after leaving behind the human body, 
have risen above celestial yokes?” 
“Upaka and Palagaṇḍa, 
and Pukkusāti, these three; 
Bhaddiya and Bhaddadeva, 
and Bāhudantī and Piṅgiya. 
They, after leaving behind the human body, 
have risen above celestial yokes.” 
“You speak well of them, 
who have let go the snares of Māra. 
Whose teaching did they understand 
to cut the bonds of rebirth?” 
“None other than the Blessed One! 
None other than your instruction! 
It was your teaching that they understood 
to cut the bonds of rebirth. 
Where name and form 
cease with nothing left over; 
understanding this teaching, 
they cut the bonds of rebirth.” 
“The words you say are deep, 
hard to understand, so very hard to wake up to. 
Whose teaching did you understand 
to be able to say such things?” 
“In the past I was a potter 
in Vebhaliṅga called Ghaṭīkāra. 
I took care of my parents 
as a lay follower of Buddha Kassapa. 
I refrained from sexual intercourse, 
I was celibate, spiritual. 
We lived in the same village; 
in the past I was your friend. 
I am the one who understands 
that these seven mendicants have been freed. 
With the complete ending of greed and hate, 
they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.” 
“That’s exactly how it was, 
just as you say, Bhaggava. 
In the past you were a potter 
in Vebhaliṅga called Ghaṭīkāra. 
You took care of your parents 
as a lay follower of Buddha Kassapa. 
You refrained from sexual intercourse, 
you were celibate, spiritual. 
We lived in the same village; 
in the past you were my friend.” 
“That’s how it was 
when those friends of old met again. 
Both of them are evolved, 
and bear their final body.” 
3. Various Sectarians )With Jantu ^n106 So I have heard. 
At one time several mendicants were staying in the Kosalan lands, in a wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. 
Then on the fifteenth day sabbath the god Jantu went up to those mendicants and addressed them in verse: 
“The mendicants used to live happily, 
as disciples of Gotama. 
Desireless they sought alms; 
desireless they used their lodgings. 
Knowing that the world was impermanent 
they made an end of suffering. 
But now they’ve made themselves hard to look after, 
like chiefs in a village. 
They eat and eat and then lie down, 
unconscious in the homes of others. 
Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha, 
I speak here only about certain people. 
They’re rejects, with no protector, 
just like those who have passed away. 
I’m speaking about 
those who live negligently. 
To those who live diligently 
I pay homage.” 
3. Various Sectarians )With Rohitassa ^n107 At Sāvatthī. 
Standing to one side, the god Rohitassa said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn?” 
“Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.” 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
how well said this was by Master Gotama. 

Once upon a time, I was a hermit called Rohitassa of the Bhoja people. I was a sky-walker with psychic powers. 
I was as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow. 
My stride was such that it could span from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. 
This wish came to me: 
‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ 
Having such speed and stride, I traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—and I passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world. 
It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
how well said this was by Master Gotama: 
‘Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.’” 
“But Reverend, I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. 
For it is in this fathom-long carcass with its perception and mind that I describe the world, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. 
The end of the world can never 
be reached by traveling. 
But without reaching the end of the world, 
there’s no release from suffering. 
So a clever person, understanding the world, 
has completed the spiritual journey <j>and gone to the end of the world. 
A peaceful one, knowing the end of the world, 
does not long for this world or the next.” 
3. Various Sectarians )With Nanda ^n108 Standing to one side, the god Nanda recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Time flies, nights pass by, 
the stages of life leave us one by one. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
you should do good deeds that bring happiness.” 
“Time flies, nights pass by, 
the stages of life leave us one by one. 
Seeing this peril in death, 
one looking for peace would drop the world’s bait.” 
3. Various Sectarians )With Nandivisāla ^n109 Standing to one side, the god Nandivisāla addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Four are its wheels, and nine its doors; 
it’s stuffed full, bound with greed, 
and born from a bog. 
Great hero, how am I supposed to live like this?” 
“Having cut the strap and harness—
wicked desire and greed—
and having plucked out craving, root and all: 
that’s how you’re supposed to live like this.” 
3. Various Sectarians )With Susīma ^n110 At Sāvatthī. 
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
“Ānanda, do you like Sāriputta?” 
“Sir, who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged? 
Venerable Sāriputta is astute, 
he has great wisdom, 
widespread wisdom, 
laughing wisdom, 
swift wisdom, 
sharp wisdom, 
and penetrating wisdom. 
He has few wishes, 
he’s content, 
secluded, 
aloof, 
and energetic. 
He gives advice 
and accepts advice; 
he accuses 
and criticizes wickedness. 
Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?” 
“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! 
Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?” 
And the Buddha repeated all of Ānanda’s terms of praise. 
















While this praise of Sāriputta was being spoken, the god Susīma approached the Buddha, escorted by a large assembly of gods. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to him: 
“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?” 
And he too repeated all the terms of praise of Sāriputta, adding, 


“For I too, sir, whenever I go to an assembly of gods, frequently hear the same terms of praise.” 



While this praise of Sāriputta was being spoken, the gods of Susīma’s assembly—uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness—generated a rainbow of bright colors. 
Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate. 
In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors. 
Suppose there was a pendant of river gold, fashioned by a deft smith, well wrought in the forge. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate. 
In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors. 
Suppose that after the rainy season the sky was clear and cloudless. At the crack of dawn, the Morning Star shines and glows and radiates. 
In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors. 
Suppose that after the rainy season the sky was clear and cloudless. As the sun rises, it would dispel all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates. 
In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors. 
Then the god Susīma recited this verse about Venerable Sāriputta in the Buddha’s presence: 
“He’s considered astute, 
Sāriputta, free of anger. 
Few in wishes, sweet, tamed, 
the hermit shines in the Teacher’s praise!” 
Then the Buddha replied to Susīma with this verse about Venerable Sāriputta: 
“He’s considered astute, 
Sāriputta, free of anger. 
Few in wishes, sweet, tamed; 
developed and well-tamed, he bides his time.” 
3. Various Sectarians )The Disciples of Various Monastics of Other Religions ^n111 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Then, late at night, several glorious gods lit up the entire Bamboo Grove. They were Asama, Sahalī, Niṅka, Ākoṭaka, Vetambarī, and Māṇavagāmiya, and all of them were disciples of various monastics of other religions. They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
Standing to one side, the god Asama recited this verse about Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddha’s presence: 
“In injuring and killing here, 
in beating and extortion, 
Kassapa saw no evil, 
nor any merit for oneself. 
What he taught should truly be trusted, 
he’s worthy of esteem as Teacher.” 
Then the god Sahalī recited this verse about Makkhali Gosala in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Through mortification in disgust of sin <j>he became well restrained. 
He gave up arguing with people. 
Refraining from false speech, he spoke the truth. 
Surely such a man does no wrong!” 
Then the god Niṅka recited this verse about the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Disgusted at sin, an alert mendicant, 
well restrained in the four controls; 
explaining what is seen and heard: 
surely he can be no sinner!” 
Then the god Ākoṭaka recited this verse about various sectarian teachers in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Pakudhaka, Kātiyāna, and Nigaṇṭha, 
as well as this Makkhali and Pūraṇa: 
Teachers of communities, attained ascetics, 
surely they weren’t far from truly good men!” 
Then the god Vetambarī replied to the god Ākoṭaka in verse: 
“Though the wretched jackal howls along, 
it never equals the lion. 
A naked liar with suspicious conduct, 
though they teach a community, is not like the good.” 
Then Māra the Wicked took possession of the god Vetambarī and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Those dedicated to mortification in disgust of sin, 
safeguarding their seclusion, 
attached to form, 
they rejoice in the heavenly realm. 
Indeed, those mortals give correct instructions 
regarding the next world.” 
Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“Whatever forms there are <j>in this world or the world beyond, 
and those of shining beauty in the sky, 
all of these you praise, Namuci, 
like bait tossed out for catching fish.” 
Then the god Māṇavagāmiya recited this verse about the Buddha in his presence: 
“Of all the mountains of Rājagaha, 
Vipula’s said to be the best. 
Seta is the best of the Himalayan peaks, 
and the sun, of travelers in space. 
The ocean is the best of seas, 
and the moon, of lights that shine at night. 
But in all the world with its gods, 
the Buddha is declared foremost.” 






The Linked Discourses on Gods are complete. 
^ck#s3(Kosalan)^cksn#s3a(1. Shackles )Young ^n112 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, 
“Does Master Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?” 
“If anyone should rightly be said to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, it’s me. 
For, great king, I have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening.” 
“Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and teach a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. That is, 
Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita of the hair blanket. 
I also asked them whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, but they made no such claim. 
So why do you, given that you’re so young in age and newly gone forth?” 
“Great king, these four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young. 
What four? 
An aristocrat, 
a serpent, 
a fire, 
and a mendicant. 
These four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“A man should not despise 
an aristocrat of impeccable lineage, 
high-born and famous, 
just because they’re young. 
For it’s possible that that lord of men, 
as aristocrat, will gain the throne. 
And in his anger he’ll execute a royal punishment, 
and have you violently beaten. 
Hence you should avoid him 
for the sake of your own life. 
Whether in village or wilderness, 
wherever a serpent is seen, 
a man should not look down on it 
or despise it for its youth. 
With its rainbow of colors, 
the serpent of fiery breath glides along. 
It lashes out and bites the fool, 
both men and women alike. 
Hence you should avoid it 
for the sake of your own life. 
A fire devours a huge amount, 
a conflagration with a blackened trail. 
A man should not look down on it 
just because it’s young. 
For once it gets fuel 
it’ll become a huge conflagration. 
It’ll lash out and burn the fool, 
both men and women alike. 
Hence you should avoid it 
for the sake of your own life. 
When a forest is burned by fire, 
a conflagration with a blackened trail, 
the shoots will spring up there again, 
with the passing of the days and nights. 
But if a mendicant endowed with ethics 
burns you with their power, 
you’ll have no sons or cattle, 
nor will your heirs find wealth. 
Childless and heirless you become, 
like a palm-tree stump. 
That’s why an astute person, 
seeing what’s good for themselves, 
would always treat these properly: 
a snake, a conflagration, 
a famous aristocrat, 
and a mendicant endowed with ethics.” 
When this was said, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
1. Shackles )A Person ^n113 At Sāvatthī. 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, how many things arise inside a person for their harm, suffering, and discomfort?” 
“Great king, three things arise inside a person for their harm, suffering, and discomfort. 
What three? 
Greed, 
hate, 
and delusion. 
These three things arise inside a person for their harm, suffering, and discomfort.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“When greed, hate, and delusion, 
have arisen inside oneself, 
they harm a person of wicked heart, 
as a reed is destroyed by its own fruit.” 
1. Shackles )Old Age and Death ^n114 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, for someone who has been reborn, is there any exemption from old age and death?” 
“Great king, for someone who has been reborn, there’s no exemption from old age and death. 
Even for well-to-do aristocrats, 
brahmins, 
or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain—when they’re born, there’s no exemption from old age and death. 
Even for mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—their bodies are liable to break up and be laid to rest.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“The fancy chariots of kings wear out, 
and this body too gets old. 
But goodness never gets old: 
so the true and the good proclaim.” 
1. Shackles )Loved ^n115 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 
‘Who are those who love themselves? And who are those who don’t love themselves?’ 
Then it occurred to me: 
‘Those who do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind 
don’t love themselves. 
Even though they may say: 
“I love myself”, they don’t really. 
Why is that? 
It’s because they treat themselves like an enemy. 
That’s why they don’t love themselves. 
Those who do good things by way of body, speech, and mind 
do love themselves. 
Even though they may say: 
“I don’t love myself”, they do really. 
Why is that? 
It’s because they treat themselves like a loved one. 
That’s why they do love themselves.’” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding: 
















“If you’d only love yourself, 
you’d not yoke yourself to wickedness. 
For happiness is not easy to find 
by someone who does bad deeds. 
When you’re seized by the terminator 
as you give up your human life, 
what can you call your own? 
What do you take when you go? 
What goes with you, 
like a shadow that never leaves? 
Both the good and the bad 
that a mortal does in this life 
is what they can call their own. 
That’s what they take when they go. 
That’s what goes with them, 
like a shadow that never leaves. 
That’s why you should do good, 
investing in the future life. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.” 
1. Shackles )Self-Protected ^n116 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 
‘Who are those who protect themselves? And who are those who don’t protect themselves?’ 
Then it occurred to me: 
‘Those who do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind 
don’t protect themselves. 
Even if they’re protected by a company of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or infantry, 
they still don’t protect themselves. 
Why is that? 
Because such protection is exterior, not interior. 
That’s why they don’t protect themselves. 
Those who do good things by way of body, speech, and mind 
do protect themselves. 
Even if they’re not protected by a company of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or infantry, 
they still protect themselves. 
Why is that? 
Because such protection is interior, not exterior. 
That’s why they do protect themselves.’” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding: 













“Restraint of the body is good; 
restraint of speech is good; 
restraint of mind is good; 
everywhere, restraint is good. 
A sincere person, restrained everywhere, 
is said to be ‘protected’.” 
1. Shackles )Few ^n117 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 
‘Few are the sentient beings in the world who, when they obtain luxury possessions, don’t get indulgent and negligent, giving in to greed for sensual pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by others. 
There are many more who, when they obtain luxury possessions, do get indulgent and negligent, giving in to greed for sensual pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by others.’” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding: 



“Full of desire for possessions and pleasures, 
greedy, infatuated by sensual pleasures; 
they don’t notice that they’ve gone too far, 
like deer falling into a trap set out. 
It’ll be bitter later on; 
for the result will be bad for them.” 
1. Shackles )Judgment ^n118 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, when I’m sitting in judgment I see well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain. But they tell deliberate lies for the sake of sensual pleasures. 
Then it occurred to me: 
‘Enough with passing judgment today. Now my dear son will be known by the judgments he makes.’” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! 
Those who are well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and householders tell deliberate lies for the sake of sensual pleasures. 
That is for their lasting harm and suffering.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“Full of desire for possessions and pleasures, 
greedy, infatuated by sensual pleasures; 
they don’t notice that they’ve gone too far, 
like fish entering a net set out. 
It’ll be bitter later on; 
for the result will be bad for them.” 
1. Shackles )With Queen Mallikā ^n119 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was upstairs in the royal longhouse together with Queen Mallikā. 
Then the king said to the queen, 
“Mallikā, is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?” 
“No, great king, there isn’t. 
But is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?” 
“For me also, Mallikā, there’s no-one.” 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala came downstairs from the stilt longhouse, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 







Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse: 
“Having explored every quarter with the mind, 
one finds no-one dearer than oneself. 
Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear; 
so one who loves themselves would harm no other.” 
1. Shackles )Sacrifice ^n120 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time a big sacrifice had been set up for King Pasenadi of Kosala. Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams—five hundred of each—had been led to the pillar for the sacrifice. 
His bondservants, employees, and workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. 
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening. 


Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses: 
“Horse sacrifice, human sacrifice, 
the sacrifices of the ‘casting of the yoke-pin’, 
the ‘royal soma drinking’, and the ‘unbarred’—
these huge violent sacrifices yield no great fruit. 
The great sages of good conduct 
don’t attend sacrifices 
where goats, sheep, and cattle 
and various creatures are killed. 
But the great sages of good conduct 
do attend non-violent sacrifices 
of regular family tradition, 
where goats, sheep, and cattle, 
and various creatures aren’t killed. 

A clever person should sacrifice like this, 
for this sacrifice is very fruitful. 
For a sponsor of sacrifices like this, 
things get better, not worse. 
Such a sacrifice is truly abundant, 
and even the deities are pleased.” 
1. Shackles )Shackles ^n121 Now at that time a large group of people had been put in shackles by King Pasenadi of Kosala—some in ropes, some in manacles, some in chains. 
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening. 

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses: 
“The wise say that shackle is not strong 
that’s made of iron, wood, or knots. 
But obsession with jeweled earrings, 
concern for your partners and children: 
this, say the wise, is a strong shackle 
dragging the indulgent down, hard to escape. 
Having cut this one too they go forth, 
unconcerned, having given up sensual pleasures.” 






^cksn#s3b(2. Childless )Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics ^n122 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat outside the gate. 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their nails were long; and they carried their stuff with shoulder-poles. 
Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three times: 
“Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala! … 
I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!” 
Then, soon after those ascetics had left, King Pasenadi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, are they among those in the world who are perfected ones or who are on the path to perfection?” 
“Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection. 
You can get to know a person’s ethics by living with them. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. 
You can get to know a person’s purity by dealing with them. … 
You can get to know a person’s resilience in times of trouble. … 
You can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.” 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
how well said this was by the Buddha. … 






Sir, these are my spies, my undercover agents returning after spying on the country. 
First they go undercover, then I have them report to me. 
And now—when they have washed off the dust and dirt, and are nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and dressed in white—they will amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.” 
Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses: 
“It’s not easy to know a man by his appearance. 
You shouldn’t trust them at first sight. 
For undisciplined men live in this world 
disguised as the disciplined. 
Like a fake earring made of clay, 
like a copper halfpenny covered with gold, 
they live hidden in the world, 
corrupt inside but impressive outside.” 
2. Childless )Five Kings ^n123 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and this discussion came up among them: 
“What’s the best of sensual pleasures?” 
Some of them said, 
“Sights are the best of sensual pleasures!” 
Others said, 
“Sounds are best!” 
Others said, 
“Smells are best!” 
Others said, 
“Tastes are best!” 
Others said, 
“Touches are best!” 
Since those kings were unable to persuade each other, 
King Pasenadi said to them, 
“Come, good sirs, let’s go to the Buddha and ask him about this. 
As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” 
“Yes, dear sir,” replied those kings. 
Then those five kings headed by Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the Buddha, and said, 












“Sir, what’s the best of sensual pleasures?” 
“Great king, which kind of sensual stimulation is best is defined by which is most agreeable, I say. 
The very same sights that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others. 
When you’re happy with certain sights, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other sight that’s better or finer. 
For you, those sights are perfect 
and supreme. 
The very same sounds … 



smells … 



tastes … 



touches that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others. 
When you’re happy with certain touches, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other touch that’s better or finer. 
For you, those touches are perfect 
and supreme.” 
Now at that time the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was sitting in that assembly. 
Then he got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
Then the lay follower Candanaṅgalika extolled the Buddha in his presence with an appropriate verse: 
“Like a fragrant pink lotus 
that blooms in the morning, its fragrance unfaded—
see Aṅgīrasa shine, 
bright as the sun in the sky!” 
Then those five kings clothed Candanaṅgalika with five upper robes. 
And Candanaṅgalika in turn endowed the Buddha with those robes. 
2. Childless )A Bucket of Rice ^n124 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala used to eat rice by the bucket. 
Then after eating King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, huffing and puffing. He bowed and sat down to one side. 
Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after eating, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse: 
“When a man is always mindful, 
knowing moderation in eating, 
his discomfort fades, 
and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.” 
Now at that time the brahmin student Sudassana was standing behind the king. 
Then King Pasenadi addressed him, 
“Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this verse in the Buddha’s presence and recite it to me whenever I am presented with a meal. 
I’ll set up a regular daily allowance of a hundred dollars for you.” 
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Sudassana. He memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, and then whenever the king was presented with a meal he would repeat it: 
“When a man is always mindful, 
knowing moderation in eating, 
his discomfort fades, 
and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.” 
Then the king gradually got used to having no more than a pint of rice. 
After some time King Pasenadi’s body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs with his hands, at that time he expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
“In both ways the Buddha has compassion for me: 
in the good of the present life and the good of the next.” 
2. Childless )Battle (1st) ^n125 At Sāvatthī. 
Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala. 
When King Pasenadi heard of this, 

he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu. 
Then the two kings met in battle. 
And in that battle Ajātasattu defeated Pasenadi, 
who withdrew to his own capital at Sāvatthī. 
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then the Buddha said: 







“Mendicants, King Ajātasattu has bad friends, companions, and associates. 
But King Pasenadi has good friends, companions, and associates. 
Yet on this day King Pasenadi will have a bad night’s sleep as one defeated.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“Victory breeds enmity; 
the defeated sleep badly. 
The peaceful sleep at ease, 
having left victory and defeat behind.” 
2. Childless )Battle (2nd) ^n126 Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala. 
When King Pasenadi heard of this, 

he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu. 
Then the two kings met in battle. 
And in that battle Pasenadi defeated Ajātasattu and captured him alive. 
Then King Pasenadi thought, 
“Even though I’ve never betrayed this King Ajātasattu, he betrayed me. Still, he is my nephew. 
Now that I’ve vanquished all of Ajātasattu’s elephant troops, cavalry, chariots, and infantry, why don’t I let him loose with just his life?” 
And that’s what he did. 
Then several mendicants … 
told the Buddha what had happened. 










Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses: 
“A man goes on plundering 
as long as it serves his ends. 
But as soon as others plunder him, 
the plunderer is plundered. 
For the fool thinks they’ve got away with it 
so long as their wickedness has not ripened. 
But as soon as that wickedness ripens, 
they fall into suffering. 
A killer creates a killer; 
a conqueror creates a conqueror; 
an abuser creates abuse, 
and a bully creates a bully. 
And so as deeds unfold 
the plunderer is plundered.” 
2. Childless )A Daughter ^n127 At Sāvatthī. 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
Then a man went up to the king and whispered in his ear, 
“Your Majesty, Queen Mallikā has given birth to a daughter.” 
When this was said, King Pasenadi was disappointed. 
Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was disappointed, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses: 
“Well, some women are better than men, 
O ruler of the people. 
Wise and virtuous, 
a devoted wife who honors her mother in law. 
And when she has a son, 
he becomes a hero, O lord of the land. 
The son of such a blessed lady 
may even rule the realm.” 
2. Childless )Diligence ^n128 At Sāvatthī. 

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, is there one thing that secures benefits for both 
the present life and lives to come?” 
“There is, great king.” 

“So what is that one thing?” 

“Diligence, great king, is one thing that secures benefits for both 
the present life and lives to come. 
The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint. So an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. 
In the same way, diligence is one thing that secures benefits for both 
the present life and lives to come.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“For one who desires a continuous flow 
of exceptional delights—
long life, beauty, and health, 
heaven, and birth in an eminent family—
the astute praise diligence 
in making merit. 
Being diligent, an astute person 
secures both benefits: 
the benefit in this life, 
and in lives to come. 
A wise one, comprehending the meaning, 
is said to be astute.” 
2. Childless )Good Friends ^n129 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha. But it’s for someone with good friends, companions, and associates, not for someone with bad friends, companions, and associates.’” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding: 

“Great king, this one time I was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville. 
Then the mendicant Ānanda came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said: 
‘Sir, good friends, companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.’ 
When he had spoken, I said to him: 
‘Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! 
Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life. 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path. 
And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? 
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. 
And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life. 
For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things. 
This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.’ 
So, great king, you should train like this: 
‘I will have good friends, companions, and associates.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
When you have good friends, companions, and associates, you should live supported by one thing: 
diligence in skillful qualities. 
When you’re diligent, supported by diligence, your ladies of the harem, 


aristocrat vassals, 


troops, 


and people of town and country will think: 
‘The king lives diligently, supported by diligence. 
We’d better live diligently, supported by diligence!’ 
When you’re diligent, supported by diligence, then not only you yourself, 
but your ladies of the harem, and your treasury and storehouses will be guarded and protected.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“For one who desires a continuous flow 
of exceptional wealth, 
the astute praise diligence 
in making merit. 
Being diligent, an astute person 
secures both benefits: 
the benefit in this life, 
and in lives to come. 
A wise one, comprehending the meaning, 
is said to be astute.” 
2. Childless )Childless (1st) ^n130 At Sāvatthī. 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the day, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
“So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 
“Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed away. 
Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his fortune to the royal compound. 
There was eight million in gold, not to mention the silver. 
And yet that financier ate meals of 
rough gruel with pickles. 
He wore clothes consisting of 
three pieces of sunn hemp. 
He traveled around in a vehicle that was 
a dilapidated little cart, holding a leaf as sunshade.” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! 
When a bad person has acquired exceptional wealth they don’t make themselves happy and pleased. Nor do they make their mother and father, partners and children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they don’t establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. 
Because they haven’t made proper use of that wealth, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. 
Since that wealth is not properly utilized, it’s wasted, not used. 
Suppose there was a lotus pond in an uninhabited region with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. 
But people don’t collect it or drink it or bathe in it or use it for any purpose. 
Since that water is not properly utilized, it’s wasted, not used. 
In the same way, when a bad person has acquired exceptional wealth … 

it’s wasted, not used. 
When a good person has acquired exceptional wealth they make themselves happy and pleased. And they make their mother and father, partners and children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. 
Because they make proper use of that wealth, rulers or bandits don’t take it, fire doesn’t consume it, flood doesn’t sweep it away, and unloved heirs don’t take it. 
Since that wealth is properly utilized, it’s used, not wasted. 
Suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. 
And people collected it and drank it and bathed in it and used it for their own purpose. 
Since that water is properly utilized, it’s used, not wasted. 
In the same way, when a good person has acquired exceptional wealth … 

it’s used, not wasted. 
As cool water in an uninhabited region 
evaporates when not drunk; 
so too when a sinner acquires wealth, 
they neither use it themselves nor give it away. 
But when a wise and sensible person <j>gets hold of wealth, 
they use it and do their duty. 
That head, having supported the family unit, 
blameless, goes to a heavenly place.” 
2. Childless )Childless (2nd) ^n131 Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the day … The Buddha said to him, 
“So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 
“Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed away. 
Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his fortune to the royal compound. 
There was ten million in gold, not to mention the silver. 
And yet that financier ate meals of 
rough gruel with pickles. 
He wore clothes consisting of 
three pieces of sunn hemp. 
He traveled around in a vehicle that was 
a dilapidated little cart, holding a leaf as sunshade.” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! 
Once upon a time, great king, that financier householder provided almsfood on behalf of an independent Buddha named Tagarasikhī. 
He instructed: ‘Give alms to that ascetic,’ before getting up from his seat and leaving. 
But after giving he regretted it: 
‘It would have been better to feed the bondservants or workers with that almsfood.’ 
What’s more, he murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune. 
Because that financier provided Tagarasikhī with almsfood, as a result of that deed he was reborn seven times in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
And as a residual result of that same deed he held the position of financier seven times right here in Sāvatthī. 
But because that financier regretted giving alms, 
as a result of that deed his mind didn’t tend to enjoy nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. 
And because that financier murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune, as a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. 
And as a residual result of that same deed, he is childless for the seventh time, his fortune ending up in the royal treasury. 
Now the old merit of that financier has been used up, and he hasn’t accumulated new merit. 
Today, great king, that financier burns in the Great Hell of Screams.” 
“Really, sir, that financier has been reborn in the Great Hell of Screams?” 
“Yes he has, great king.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“Grain, wealth, silver, and gold, 
or whatever other possessions there are; 
bondservants, workers, employees, 
and those dependent for their livelihood: 
you must go on without taking these; 
all of them are left behind. 
But the deeds you do 
by body, speech, and mind—
that’s what you can call your own. 
That’s what you take when you go. 
That’s what goes with you, 
like a shadow that never leaves. 
That’s why you should do good, 
investing in the future life. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.” 








^cksn#s3c(3. Kosala )Persons ^n132 At Sāvatthī. 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Great king, these four people are found in the world. 
What four? 
The dark bound for darkness, 
the dark bound for light, 
the light bound for darkness, 
and the light bound for light. 
And how is a person dark and bound for darkness? 
It’s when some person is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. 
And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting. 
And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
This person is like someone who goes from darkness to darkness, from blackness to blackness, from bloodstain to bloodstain. 

That’s how a person is dark and bound for darkness. 
And how is a person dark and bound for light? 
It’s when some person is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. 
And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting. 
But they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
This person is like someone who ascends from the ground to a couch; from a couch to horseback; from horseback to an elephant; and from an elephant to a stilt longhouse. 

That’s how a person is dark and bound for light. 
And how is a person light and bound for darkness? 
It’s when some person is reborn in an eminent family—a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain. 
And they’re attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. 
But they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
This person is like someone who descends from a stilt longhouse to an elephant; from an elephant to horseback; from horseback to a couch; and from a couch to the ground; and from the ground they enter darkness. 

That’s how a person is light and bound for darkness. 
And how is a person light and bound for light? 
It’s when some person is reborn in an eminent family—a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain. 
And they’re attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. 
And they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
This person is like someone who shifts from one couch to another; from the back of one horse to another; from one elephant to another; or from one stilt longhouse to another. 

That’s how a person is light and bound for light. 
These are the four people found in the world.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“O king, some people are poor, 
faithless and stingy. 
Miserly, with bad intentions, 
they lack regard, they have wrong view. 
They abuse and insult 
ascetics and brahmins 
and other renunciates. 
They’re nihilists and bullies, 
who prevent others from giving 
food to beggars. 
O king, ruler of the people: 
when such people die 
they fall into the terrible hell—
from darkness they’re bound for darkness. 
O king, some people are poor, 
but faithful and not stingy. 
They give with best of intentions, 
that peaceful-hearted person. 
They rise for and bow to 
ascetics and brahmins 
and other nomads. 
Training in moral conduct, 
they don’t prevent others from giving 
food to beggars. 
O king, ruler of the people: 
when such people die 
they go to the heaven of the Three and Thirty—
from darkness they’re bound for light. 
O king, some people are rich, 
but faithless and stingy. 
Miserly, with bad intentions, 
they lack regard, they have wrong view. 
They abuse and insult 
ascetics and brahmins 
and other nomads 
They’re nihilists and bullies, 
who prevent others from giving 
food to beggars. 
O king, ruler of the people: 
when such people die 
they fall into the terrible hell—
from light they’re bound for darkness. 
O king, some people are rich, 
faithful and not stingy. 
They give with best of intentions, 
that peaceful-hearted person. 
They rise for and bow to 
ascetics and brahmins 
and other renunciates. 
Training in moral conduct, 
they don’t prevent others from giving 
food to beggars. 
O king, ruler of the people: 
when such people die 
they go to the heaven of the Three and Thirty—
from light they’re bound for light.” 
3. Kosala )Grandmother ^n133 At Sāvatthī. 
King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him, 
“So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 
“Sir, my grandmother has passed away. She was old, elderly and senior. She was advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life; she was a hundred and twenty years old. 
But I loved my grandmother; she was dear to me. 
If by giving away the elephant-treasure I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it. 

If by giving away the horse-treasure I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it. 

If by giving away a prize village I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it. 

If by giving away the whole country I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it.” 

“Great king, all sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.” 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
how well said this was by the Buddha: 
‘All sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.’” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! 
All sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death. 
It’s like the vessels made by potters. Whatever kind they are, whether baked or unbaked, all of them are liable to break apart. Breaking is their end; they’re not exempt from breakage. 
In the same way, all sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“All beings will die, 
for life ends with death. 
They pass on according to their deeds, 
reaping the fruits of good and bad. 
Those who do bad go to hell, 
and if you do good you go to heaven. 
That’s why you should do good, 
investing in the future life. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.” 
3. Kosala )The World ^n134 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, how many things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort?” 
“Great king, three things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort. 
What three? 
Greed, 
hate, 
and delusion. 
These three things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort.” 
That is what the Buddha said. … 
“When greed, hate, and delusion, 
have arisen inside oneself, 
they harm a person of wicked heart, 
as a reed is destroyed by its own fruit.” 
3. Kosala )Archery ^n135 At Sāvatthī. 
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, where should a gift be given?” 
“Wherever your heart feels inspired, great king.” 
“But sir, where is a gift very fruitful?” 
“Where a gift should be given is one thing, great king, but where a gift is very fruitful is another. 
A gift is very fruitful when it’s given to an ethical person, not so much to an unethical person. 
Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. 
What do you think, great king? 
Suppose you were at war, ready to fight a battle. 
Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is untrained, inexpert, unfit, inexperienced. And he’s fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee. 
Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?” 
“No, sir, I would have no use for such a man.” 
“What about a brahmin youth, 
a peasant youth, 
or a menial youth who was similar?” 
“No, sir, I would have no use for such a man.” 
“What do you think, great king? 
Suppose you were at war, ready to fight a battle. 
Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is trained, expert, fit, experienced. And he’s fearless, brave, bold, standing his ground. 
Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?” 
“Yes, sir, I would have a use for such a man.” 
“What about a brahmin youth, 
a peasant youth, 
or a menial youth who was similar? 
Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?” 
“Yes, sir, I would have a use for such a man.” 
“In the same way, a gift to anyone who has given up five factors and possesses five factors is very fruitful, no matter what family they’ve gone forth from. 
What are the five factors they’ve given up? 
Sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. 
These are the five factors they’ve given up. 
What are the five factors they possess? 
The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision of freedom. 
These are the five factors they possess. 
I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and possesses these five factors is very fruitful.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“Any youth skilled at archery, 
powerful and vigorous, 
would be employed by a king going to war—
one is not a coward by reason of birth. 
Just so, whoever is settled 
in the qualities of patience and gentleness, 
a clever person with noble conduct, 
should be venerated even if they’re low born. 
You should build lovely hermitages 
and settle learned people in them. 
You should set up water supplies in barren regions 
and passages in places hard to travel. 
Food, drink, edibles, 
clothes, and lodgings 
should be given to the upright ones, 
with a clear and confident heart. 
The thundering rain cloud, 
its hundred peaks wreathed in lightning, 
pours down over the rich earth, 
soaking the uplands and valleys. 
So too an astute person, 
faithful and learned, 
should prepare a meal to satisfy 
renunciates with food and drink. 
Rejoicing, they strew gifts about, 
crying ‘Give! give!’ 
For that is their thunder, 
like the gods when it rains. 
That stream of merit so abundant 
showers down on the giver.” 
3. Kosala )The Simile of the Mountain ^n136 At Sāvatthī. 
King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him, 
“So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 
“Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Today I have been busy fulfilling the duties of such kings.” 
“What do you think, great king? 
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the east. 
He’d approach you and say: 
‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the east. 
There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. 
So then, great king, do what you must!’ 
Then a second trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the west … 
a third from the north … 
and a fourth from the south. 
He’d approach you and say: 
‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the south. 
There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. 
So then, great king, do what you must!’ 
Should such a dire threat arise—a terrible loss of human life, when human birth is so rare—what would you do?” 
“Sir, what could I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” 
“I tell you, great king, I announce to you: old age and death are advancing upon you. 
Since old age and death are advancing upon you, what would you do?” 
“Sir, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions? 
Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Such kings engage in battles of elephants, 


cavalry, 
chariots, 
or infantry. 
But there is no place, no scope for such battles when old age and death are advancing. 
In this royal court there are ministers of wise counsel who are capable of dividing an approaching enemy by wise counsel. 
But there is no place, no scope for such diplomatic battles when old age and death are advancing. 
In this royal court there is abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. Using this wealth we can bribe an approaching enemy. 
But there is no place, no scope for such monetary battles when old age and death are advancing. 
When old age and death are advancing, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” 
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! 
When old age and death are advancing, what can you do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“Suppose there were vast mountains 
of solid rock touching the sky 
drawing in from all sides 
and crushing the four quarters. 
So too old age and death 
advance upon all living creatures—
aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, 
menials, outcastes, and scavengers. 
They spare nothing. 
They crush all beneath them. 
There’s nowhere for elephants to take a stand, 
nor chariots nor infantry. 
They can’t be defeated 
by diplomatic battles or by wealth. 
That’s why an astute person, 
seeing what’s good for themselves, 
being wise, would place faith 
in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. 
Whoever lives by the teaching 
in body, speech, and mind, 
is praised in this life 
and departs to rejoice in heaven.” 






The Linked Discourses with the Kosalan are completed. 
^ck#s4(Māra)^cksn#s4a(1. Life Span )Mortification ^n137 So I have heard. 
At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
“I am truly freed from that grueling work! 
Thank goodness I’m freed from that pointless grueling work. 
Thank goodness that, steadfast and mindful, I have attained awakening.” 
And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, went up to him and addressed him in verse: 
“You’ve departed from the practice of mortification 
by which humans purify themselves. 
You’re impure, but think yourself pure; 
you’ve strayed from the path of purity.” 
Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“I realized that it’s pointless; 
all that mortification in search of immortality 
is as futile 
as oars and rudder on dry land. 
Ethics, immersion, and wisdom: 
by developing this path to awakening 
I attained ultimate purity. 
You’re beaten, terminator!” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )In the Form of an Elephant King ^n138 So I have heard. 
At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, manifested in the form of a huge elephant king and approached him. 
Its head was like a huge block of soapstone. 

Its tusks were like pure silver. 

Its trunk was like a long plough pole. 

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: 
“Transmigrating for such a long time, 
you’ve made forms beautiful and ugly. 
Enough of this, Wicked One! 
You’re beaten, terminator!” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )Beautiful ^n139 So I have heard. 
At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and while not far away generated a rainbow of bright colors, both beautiful and ugly. 
Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“Transmigrating for such a long time, 
you’ve made forms beautiful and ugly. 
Enough of this, Wicked One! 
You’re beaten, terminator. 
Those who are well restrained 
in body, speech, and mind 
don’t fall under Māra’s sway, 
nor are they your lackies.” 
Then Māra … vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )Māra’s Snares (1st) ^n140 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, I have attained and realized supreme freedom through proper attention and proper effort. 
You too should attain and realize supreme freedom through proper attention and proper effort.” 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“You’re bound by Māra’s snares, 
both human and divine. 
You’re bound by Māra’s bonds: 
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” 
“I’m freed from Māra’s snares, 
both human and divine. 
I’m freed from Māra’s bonds. 
You’re beaten, terminator!” 
Then Māra … vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )Māra’s Snares (2nd) ^n141 At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, I am freed from all snares, both human and divine. 
You are also freed from all snares, both human and divine. 
Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. 
Let not two go by one road. 
Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. 
There will be those who understand the teaching! 
I will travel to Uruvelā, the village of Senāni, in order to teach the Dhamma.” 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“You’re bound by all snares, 
both human and divine. 
You’re bound by the great bond: 
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” 
“I’m freed from all snares, 
both human and divine. 
I’m freed from the great bonds; 
You’re beaten, terminator!” 
Then Māra … vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )A Serpent ^n142 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, manifested in the form of a huge serpent king and approached him. 
Its body was like a huge canoe carved from a single tree. 

Its hood was like a large brewer’s sieve. 

Its eyes were like those big bronze dishes from Kosala. 

Its tongue flickered from its mouth like lightning flashes in a thunderstorm. 

The sound of its breathing was like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows. 

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“A self-controlled sage frequents 
empty buildings for lodging. 
It’s appropriate for such a person 
to live there after relinquishing. 
Though there are lots of creepy crawlies, 
and lots of flies and snakes, 
they wouldn’t stir a hair 
of a great sage in that empty hut. 
Though the sky may split and the earth may quake, 
and all creatures be stricken with fear; 
and even if an arrow’s aimed at their breast, 
the Buddhas take no shelter in attachments.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )Sleeping ^n143 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
He spent much of the night walking mindfully in the open. At the crack of dawn he washed his feet and entered his dwelling. 
He laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“What, you’re asleep? <j>Really, you’re asleep? 
You sleep like a loser—<j>what’s up with that? 
You sleep, thinking that the hut is empty. 
You sleep when the sun has come up—<j>what’s up with that?” 
“For them there is no craving—
the weaver, the clinger—<j>to track them anywhere. 
With the ending of all attachments <j>the awakened Buddha sleeps. 
What’s that got to do with you, Māra?” 
Then Māra … vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )Delighting ^n144 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Your children bring you delight! 
Your cattle also bring you delight! 
For attachments are a man’s delight; 
without attachments there’s no delight.” 
“Your children bring you sorrow. 
Your cattle also bring you sorrow. 
For attachments are a man’s sorrow; 
without attachments there are no sorrows.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )Life Span (1st) ^n145 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, the life span of humans is short. 
You must go to the next life. So you should do what is skillful, you should practice the spiritual life. 
No-one born is immortal. 
A long life is a hundred years or a little more.” 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“The life of humans is long! 
A good person wouldn’t scorn it. 
Live like a suckling babe, 
for Death has not come for you.” 
“The life of humans is short, 
and a good person scorns it. 
They should live as though their head was on fire, 
for Death comes for everyone.” 
Then Māra … vanished right there. 
1. Life Span )Life Span (2nd) ^n146 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
There the Buddha … said: 
“Mendicants, the life span of humans is short. 
You must go to the next life. So you should do what is skillful, you should practice the spiritual life. 
No-one born is immortal. 
A long life is a hundred years or a little more.” 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“The days and nights don’t rush by, 
and life isn’t cut short. 
The life of mortals keeps rolling on, 
like a chariot’s rim around the hub.” 
“The days and nights rush by, 
and then life is cut short. 
The life of mortals wastes away, 
like the water in tiny streams.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 






^cksn#s4b(2. Rule )Boulders ^n147 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and crushed some large boulders close by him. 
Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: 
“Even if you shake 
this entire Vulture’s Peak, 
the rightly released, 
the awakened, are unshaken.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
2. Rule )Lion ^n148 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
Then Māra thought, 
“The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“Why now do you roar like a lion? 
You’re so self-assured in the assembly! 
For there is someone who’ll wrestle with you, 
so why do you imagine you’re the victor?” 
“The great heroes they roar, 
self-assured in the assemblies. 
The Realized One, attained to power, 
has crossed over clinging to the world.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
2. Rule )A Splinter ^n149 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi deer park. 
Now at that time the Buddha’s foot had been cut by a splinter. 
The Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. 
But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. 
And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“Are you feeble that you lie down? <j>Or are you drunk on poetry? 
Don’t you have all that you need? 
Alone in a secluded lodging, 
why this sleeping, sleepyhead?” 
“I’m not feeble that I lie down, <j>nor am I drunk on poetry. 
Having reached the goal, I’m rid of sorrow. 
Alone in a secluded lodging, 
I lie down full of compassion for all living creatures. 
Even those with a dart stuck in the breast, 
piercing the heart again and again, 
are able to get some sleep. 
So why not I, whose dart is drawn out? 
I don’t lie awake tense, nor do I fear to sleep. 
The days and nights don’t disturb me, 
as I see no decline for myself in the world. 
That’s why I lie down <j>full of compassion for all living creatures.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
2. Rule )Appropriate ^n150 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near the brahmin village of Ekasālā. 
Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople. 
Then Māra thought, 
“The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople. 
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“It’s not appropriate for you 
to instruct others. 
As you engage in this, 
don’t get caught up in favoring and opposing.” 
“The Buddha instructs others 
out of compassion for their welfare. 
The Realized One is liberated 
from favoring and opposing.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
2. Rule )A Mental Snare ^n151 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“There’s a mental snare 
wandering the sky. 
I’ll bind you with it—
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” 
“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, 
and touches so delightful: 
desire for these is gone from me. 
You’re beaten, terminator!” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
2. Rule )The Alms Bowls ^n152 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the five grasping aggregates. 
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Then Māra thought, 
“This ascetic Gotama is educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the five grasping aggregates. 
And the mendicants are paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” 
At that time several alms bowls were placed in the open air. 
Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of an ox and approached those bowls. 
One of the mendicants said to another, 
“Mendicant, mendicant, that ox will break the bowls.” 
When this was said, the Buddha said to that mendicant, 
“Mendicant, that’s no ox. 
That’s Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes!” 
Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: 
“Sights, feeling, and perception, 
consciousness and what is chosen: 
‘I am not this’ and ‘this is not mine’; 
that’s how to be free of desire for them. 
When you’re detached, secure, 
all fetters transcended, 
though Māra and his army chase everywhere 
they never find you.” 
Then Māra … vanished right there. 
2. Rule )The Six Fields of Contact ^n153 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the six fields of contact. 
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Then Māra thought, 
“This ascetic Gotama is educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the six fields of contact. 
And those mendicants are paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and made a terrifyingly loud noise close by him. It seemed as if the earth were shattering, so that one of the mendicants said to another, 
“Mendicant, mendicant, it seems like the earth is shattering!” 
When this was said, the Buddha said to that mendicant, 
“Mendicant, that’s not the earth shattering. 
That’s Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes!” 
Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: 
“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, 
touches, and thoughts, the lot of them—
this is the dreadful bait 
that the world’s infatuated by. 
But a mindful disciple of the Buddha 
has transcended all that. 
Having slipped free of Māra’s sway, 
they shine like the sun.” 
Then Māra … vanished right there. 
2. Rule )Alms Food ^n154 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans near the brahmin village of Pañcasālā. 
Now at that time in Pañcasālā the young women were taking care of guests. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Pañcasālā for alms. 
Now at that time Māra had possessed the brahmins and householders of Pañcasālā, so that they thought, 
“Don’t let the ascetic Gotama get any alms!” 
Then the Buddha left the village with his bowl as clean-washed as it was when he entered for alms. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and said to him, 
“Well, ascetic, did you get any alms?” 
“Wicked One, did you make sure I didn’t get any alms?” 
“Well then, sir, let the Buddha enter Pañcasālā a second time for alms. 
I’ll make sure you get alms.” 
“Māra’s made bad karma 
in attacking the Realized One. 
Wicked One, do you imagine that 
your wickedness won’t bear fruit? 
Let us live so very happily, 
we who have nothing. 
We shall feed on rapture, 
like the gods of streaming radiance.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
2. Rule )A Farmer ^n155 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. 
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Then Māra thought, 
“The ascetic Gotama is giving a Dhamma talk about extinguishment … and the mendicants are listening well. 
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” 
Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a farmer carrying a large plough on his shoulder. He held a long goad, his hair was messy, he was clad in sunn hemp, and his feet were muddy. He went up to the Buddha and said to him, 
“So, ascetic, did you happen to see any oxen?” 
“But what have you to do with oxen, Wicked One?” 
“Mine alone, ascetic, is the eye, mine are sights, mine is the field of eye contact consciousness. 
Where can you escape me, ascetic? 
Mine alone is the ear … 
nose … 
tongue … 
body … 
mind, mine are thoughts, mine is the field of mind contact consciousness. 
Where can you escape me, ascetic?” 
“Yours alone, Wicked One, is the eye, yours are sights, yours is the field of eye contact consciousness. 
Where there is no eye, no sights, no eye contact consciousness—you have no place there, Wicked One! 
Yours alone is the ear … 

nose … 

tongue … 
body … 
mind, yours are thoughts, yours is the field of mind contact consciousness. 
Where there is no mind, no thoughts, no mind contact consciousness—you have no place there, Wicked One!” 
“The things they call ‘mine’, 
and those who say ‘it’s mine’: 
if your mind remains there, 
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” 
“The things they speak of aren’t mine; 
I’m not someone who speaks like that. 
So know this, Wicked One: 
you won’t even see the path I take.” 
Then Māra … vanished right there. 
2. Rule )Ruling ^n156 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans, in a wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas. 
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
“I wonder if it’s possible to rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow?” 
And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, went up to him and said, 
“Rule, Blessed One! Rule, Holy One! Rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow!” 
“But what do you see, Wicked One, that you say this to me?” 

“The Blessed One, sir, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. 
If he wished, the Blessed One need only determine that the Himalaya, king of mountains, was gold, and it would turn into gold.” 
“Take a golden mountain, 
made entirely of gold, and double it—
it’s still not enough for one! 
Knowing this, live a moral life. 
When a person has seen where suffering comes from 
how could they incline towards sensual pleasures? 
Realizing that attachment is a snare in the world, 
a person would train to remove it.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 






^cksn#s4c(3. Māra )Several ^n157 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Silāvatī. 
Now at that time several mendicants were meditating not far from the Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute. 
Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a brahmin with a large matted dreadlock, wearing an antelope hide. He was old, bent double, wheezing, and held a staff made of cluster fig tree wood. He went up to those mendicants and said, 
“You’ve gone forth while young, reverends. You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures. 
Enjoy human sensual pleasures. 
Don’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.” 
“Brahmin, that’s not what we’re doing. 
We’re giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present. 
For the Buddha says that sensual pleasures take effect over time; they give much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. 
But this teaching is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.” 
When they had spoken, Māra the Wicked shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and departed leaning on his staff. 
Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said, 











“Mendicants, that was no brahmin. 
That was Māra the Wicked who came to pull the wool over your eyes!” 
Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse: 
“When a person has seen where suffering comes from 
how could they incline towards sensual pleasures? 
Realizing that attachment is a snare in the world, 
a person would train to remove it.” 
3. Māra )With Samiddhi ^n158 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Silāvatī. 
Now at that time Venerable Samiddhi was meditating not far from the Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute. 
Then as Venerable Samiddhi was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, 
to have a teacher who is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha! 
I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, 
to have gone forth in a teaching and training so well explained! 
I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, 
to have spiritual companions who are ethical and of good character.” 
And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what Samiddhi was thinking, went up to him and made a terrifyingly loud noise close by him. It seemed as if the earth was shattering. 
Then Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said, 









“Samiddhi, that’s not the earth shattering. 
That’s Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes! 
Go back to that same place, Samiddhi, and meditate, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Samiddhi. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
And for a second time Samiddhi was meditating in that same place, diligent, ardent, and resolute. 
And for a second time he had the same thought … 
and Māra made an earth-shattering noise. 

Then Samiddhi addressed Māra the Wicked One in verse: 
“I went forth out of faith 
from the lay life to homelessness. 
My mindfulness and wisdom are mature, 
my mind is serene in immersion. 
Make whatever illusions you want, 
it won’t bother me.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The mendicant Samiddhi knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
3. Māra )With Godhika ^n159 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Now at that time Venerable Godhika was staying on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock. 
Then Venerable Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart. 
But then he fell away from that temporary freedom of heart. 
For a second … 

third … 

fourth … 

fifth … 

sixth time Godhika experienced temporary freedom of heart. 
But for a sixth time he fell away from it. 
For a seventh time Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart. 
Then he thought, 
“I’ve fallen away from this temporary freedom of heart no less than six times. 
Why don’t I slit my wrists?” 
And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what Godhika was thinking, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“O great hero, O greatly wise! 
Shining with power and glory. 
You’ve gone beyond all threats and perils, 
I bow to your feet, O seer! 
Great hero, master of death, 
your disciple longs for death, 
he’s planning for it. 
Stop him, O light-bringer! 
For how, Blessed One, can a disciple of yours, 
one who loves your teaching, 
a trainee who hasn’t achieved their heart’s desire, 
take his own life, O renowned one?” 
Now at that time Venerable Godhika had already slit his wrists. 
Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: 
“This is how the wise act, 
for they don’t long for life. 
Having plucked out craving, root and all, 
Godhika is extinguished.” 
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, 
“Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili where Godhika, who came from a good family, slit his wrists.” 
“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. 
The Buddha saw Godhika off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates. 
Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between. 
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, 
“Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“That’s Māra the Wicked searching for Godhika’s consciousness, wondering: 
‘Where is Godhika’s consciousness established?’ 
But since his consciousness is not established, Godhika is extinguished.” 
Then Māra, carrying his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood apple, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“Above, below, all round, 
in the four quarters and in-between, 
I’ve been searching without success: 
where has that Godhika got to?” 
“He was a wise and steadfast sage, 
a meditator who loved absorption. 
By day and by night he applied himself, 
without concern for his life. 
He defeated the army of death, 
and won’t return for any future life. 
Having plucked out craving, root and all 
Godhika is extinguished.” 
So stricken with sorrow 
that his harp dropped from his armpit, 
that spirit, downcast, 
vanished right there. 
3. Māra )Seven Years of Following ^n160 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
Now at that time Māra the Wicked had been following the Buddha for seven years hoping to find a vulnerability without success. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“Are you swamped by sorrow <j>that you meditate in the forest? 
Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one? 
Or perhaps you’ve committed <j>some crime in the village? 
Why don’t you get too close to people? 
And why does no-one get close to you?” 
“I’ve dug out the root of sorrow completely. 
I practice absorption free of guilt or sorrow. 
I’ve cut off all greed and prayer for future lives. 
Undefiled, I practice absorption, <j>O kinsman of the negligent!” 
“The things they call ‘mine’, 
and those who say ‘it’s mine’: 
if your mind remains there, 
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” 
“The things they speak of aren’t mine; 
I’m not someone who speaks like that. 
So know this, Wicked One: 
you won’t even see the path I take.” 
“If you’ve discovered the path 
that’s safe, and leads to the deathless, 
go and walk that path alone—
why teach it to anyone else?” 
“Those crossing to the far shore 
ask what’s beyond the domain of Death. 
When I’m asked, I explain to them 
the truth without attachments.” 
“Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village, 
and a crab lived there. 
Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land. 
Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone. 
And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn’t be able to return down into that lotus pond. 
In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all my tricks, dodges, and evasions. 
Now I’m not able to approach the Buddha again in hopes of finding a vulnerability.” 
Then Māra the Wicked recited these verses of disappointment in the Buddha’s presence: 
“A crow once circled a stone 
that looked like a lump of fat. 
‘Perhaps I’ll find something tender,’ it thought, 
‘perhaps there’s something tasty.’ 
But finding nothing tasty, 
the crow left that place. 
Like the crow that pecked the stone, 
I leave Gotama disappointed.” 
3. Māra )Māra’s Daughters ^n161 And then Māra the Wicked, after reciting these verses of disillusionment in the Buddha’s presence, left that place. He sat cross-legged on the ground not far from the Buddha, silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, scratching the ground with a stick. 
Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked, and addressed him in verse: 
“Why so downhearted, dad? 
What man are you upset about? 
We’ll catch him with the snare of lust, 
like an elephant in the wild. 
We’ll tie him up and bring him back—
he’ll fall under your sway!” 
“In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One. 
He’s not easily seduced by lust. 
He has slipped free of Māra’s sway; 
that’s why I’m so upset.” 
Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and said to him, 
“We serve at your feet, ascetic.” 
But the Buddha ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. 
Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan. 
“Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes. 
Why don’t we each manifest in the form of a hundred young maidens?” 
So that’s what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him, 
“We serve at your feet, ascetic.” 
But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. 
Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan. 
“Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes. 
Why don’t we each manifest in the form of a hundred women who have never given birth?” 
So that’s what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him, 
“We serve at your feet, ascetic.” 
But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. 
Then Craving, Delight, and Lust … 


each manifested in the form of a hundred women who have given birth once … 





women who have given birth twice … 




middle-aged women … 




old women … 
But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. 
Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side and said, 
“What our father said is true: 
‘In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One. 
He’s not easily seduced by lust. 
He has slipped free of Māra’s sway; 
that’s why I’m so upset.’ 
For if we had come on to any ascetic or brahmin like this who was not free of lust, his heart would explode, or he’d spew hot blood from his mouth, or he’d go mad and lose his mind. 
He’d dry up, wither away, and shrivel up like a green reed that was mowed down.” 

Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side. 
Māra’s daughter Craving addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Are you swamped by sorrow <j>that you meditate in the forest? 
Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one? 
Or perhaps you’ve committed <j>some crime in the village? 
Why don’t you get too close to people? 
And why does no-one get close to you?” 
“I’ve reached the goal, peace of heart. 
Having conquered the army <j>of the likable and pleasant, 
alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss. 
That’s why I don’t get too close to people, 
and no-one gets too close to me.” 
Then Māra’s daughter Delight addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“How does a mendicant who has crossed five floods 
usually meditate here while crossing the sixth? 
How do they usually practice absorption <j>so that sensual perceptions 
are kept out and don’t get hold of them?” 
“With tranquil body and mind well freed, 
without making plans, mindful, homeless; 
understanding the teaching, <j>they practice absorption without placing the mind; 
they’re not shaking or drifting or rigid. 
That’s how a mendicant who has crossed five floods 
usually meditates here while crossing the sixth. 
That’s how they usually practice absorption <j>so that sensual perceptions 
are kept out and don’t get hold of them.” 
Then Māra’s daughter Lust addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“He lives with his community after cutting off craving, 
and many of the faithful will cross over for sure. 
Alas, this homeless one will snatch many men away, 
and lead them past the King of Death!” 
“The great heroes they lead 
by means of the true teaching. 
When the Realized Ones are leading by the teaching, 
how could anyone who knows be jealous?” 
Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked. 
Māra the Wicked saw them coming off in the distance, 
and addressed them in verse: 
“Fools! You drill into a mountain 
with lotus stalks! 
You dig up a hill with your nails! 
You chew iron with your teeth! 
You seek a footing in the deeps, as it were, 
while lifting a rock with your head! 
After attacking a stump with your breast, as it were, 
you leave Gotama disappointed.” 
“They came in their splendor—
Craving, Delight, and Lust. 
But the Teacher brushed them off right there, 
like the breeze, a fallen tuft.” 






The Linked Discourses with Māra are complete. 
^ck#s5(Nuns)^cksn#s5a(1. Nuns )With Āḷavikā ^n162 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then the nun Āḷavikā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from almsround, she went to the Dark Forest seeking seclusion. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Āḷavikā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from seclusion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: 
“There’s no escape in the world, 
so what will seclusion do for you? 
Enjoy the delights of sensual pleasure; 
don’t regret it later.” 
Then the nun Āḷavikā thought, 
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” 
Then she thought, 
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from seclusion!” 
Then Āḷavikā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“There is an escape in the world, 
and I’ve personally experienced it with wisdom. 
O Wicked One, kinsman of the negligent, 
you don’t know that place. 
Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes; 
the aggregates are their chopping block. 
What you call sensual delight 
has become no delight for me.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Āḷavikā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Somā ^n163 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Somā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from almsround, she went to the Dark Forest, 
plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Somā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: 
“That state’s very challenging; 
it’s for the sages to attain. 
It’s not possible for a woman, 
with her two-fingered wisdom.” 
Then the nun Somā thought, 
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” 
Then she thought, 
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” 
Then Somā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“What difference does womanhood make 
when the mind is serene, 
and knowledge is present 
as you rightly discern the Dhamma. 
Surely someone who might think: 
‘I am woman’, or ‘I am man’, 
or ‘I am’ anything at all, 
is fit for Māra to address.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Somā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Kisāgotamī ^n164 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Kisāgotamī robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from almsround, she went to the Dark Forest, 
plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Kisāgotamī feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: 
“Why do you sit alone and cry 
as if your children have died? 
You’ve come to the woods all alone—
you must be looking for a man!” 
Then the nun Kisāgotamī thought, 
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” 
Then she thought, 
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” 
Then Kisāgotamī, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“I’ve got over the death of children, 
and I’m finished with men. 
I don’t grieve or lament, 
and I’m not afraid of you, sir! 
Relishing is destroyed in every respect, 
and the mass of darkness is shattered. 
I’ve defeated the army of death, 
and live without defilements.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Kisāgotamī knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Vijayā ^n165 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Vijayā robed up in the morning … 
and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Vijayā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: 
“You’re so young and beautiful, 
and I’m a youth in my prime. 
Come, my lady, let us enjoy 
the music of a five-piece band.” 
Then the nun Vijayā thought, 
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” 
Then she thought, 
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” 
Then Vijayā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, 
and touches so delightful. 
I hand them right back to you, Māra, 
for I have no use for them. 
This body is foul, 
decaying and frail. 
I’m horrified and repelled by it, 
and I’ve eradicated sensual craving. 
There are beings in the realm of luminous form, 
others established in the formless, 
and also those peaceful attainments: 
I’ve destroyed the darkness regarding all of them.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Vijayā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Uppalavaṇṇā ^n166 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā robed up in the morning … 
and stood at the root of a sal tree in full flower. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Uppalavaṇṇā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: 
“You’ve come to this sal tree all crowned with flowers, 
and stand at its root all alone, O nun. 
Your beauty is second to none; 
silly girl, aren’t you afraid of rascals?” 
Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā thought, 
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” 
Then she thought, 
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” 
Then Uppalavaṇṇā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“Even if 100,000 rascals like you 
were to come here, 
I’d stir not a hair nor panic. 
I’m not scared of you, Māra, even alone. 
I’ll vanish, 
or I’ll enter your belly; 
I could stand between your eyebrows 
and you still wouldn’t see me. 
I’m the master of my own mind, 
I’ve developed the bases of psychic power well. 
I’m free from all bonds, 
and I’m not afraid of you, sir!” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Uppalavaṇṇā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Cālā ^n167 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Cālā robed up in the morning … 
and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to Cālā and said to her, 
“Nun, what don’t you approve of?” 
“I don’t approve of rebirth, sir.” 
“Why don’t you approve of rebirth? 
When you’re born, you get to enjoy sensual pleasures. 
Who put this idea in your head: 
‘Nun, don’t approve of rebirth’?” 
“Death comes to those who are born, 
when you’re born you undergo sufferings—
killing, caging, misery—
that’s why you shouldn’t approve of rebirth. 
The Buddha taught me the Dhamma 
for passing beyond rebirth, 
for giving up all suffering; 
he settled me in the truth. 
There are beings in the realm of luminous form, 
and others established in the formless. 
Not understanding cessation, 
they return in future lives.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Cālā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Upacālā ^n168 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Upacālā robed up in the morning … 
and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to Upacālā and said to her, 
“Nun, where do you want to be reborn?” 
“I don’t want to be reborn anywhere, sir.” 
“There are the Gods of the Thirty-Three, <j>and those of Yama; 
also the Joyful Deities, 
the Gods Who Love to Create, 
and the Gods Who Control <j>the Creations of Others. 
Set your heart on such places, 
and you’ll undergo delight.” 
“The Gods of the Thirty-Three, <j>and those of Yama; 
also the Joyful Deities, 
the Gods Who Love to Create, 
and the Gods Who Control <j>the Creations of Others—
they’re bound with the bonds of sensuality; 
they fall under your sway again. 
All the world is on fire, 
all the world is smoldering, 
all the world is ablaze, 
all the world is rocking. 
My mind adores that place 
where Māra cannot go; 
it’s not shaking or burning, 
and not frequented by ordinary people.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Upacālā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Sīsupacālā ^n169 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Sīsupacālā robed up in the morning … 
and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Then Māra the Wicked went up to Sīsupacālā and said to her, 
“Nun, whose creed do you believe in?” 
“I don’t believe in anyone’s creed, sir.” 
“In whose name did you shave your head? 
You look like an ascetic, 
but you don’t believe in any creed. 
Why do you live as if lost?” 
“Followers of other creeds 
are confident in their views. 
But I don’t believe in their teaching, 
for they’re no experts in the Dhamma. 
But there is one born in the Sakyan clan, 
the unrivaled Buddha, 
champion, dispeller of Māra, 
everywhere undefeated, 
everywhere freed, and unattached, 
the all-seeing seer. 
He has attained the end of all deeds, 
freed with the ending of attachments. 
That Blessed One is my Teacher, 
and I believe in his instruction.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Sīsupacālā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Selā ^n170 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Selā robed up in the morning … 
and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Selā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps … 
addressed her in verse: 
“Who created this puppet? 
Where is its maker? 
Where has the puppet arisen? 
And where does it cease?” 
Then the nun Selā thought, 
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” 
Then she thought, 
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” 
Then Selā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“This puppet isn’t self-made, 
nor is this misery made by another. 
It comes to be because of a cause, 
and ceases when the cause breaks up. 
It’s like a seed that’s sown 
in a field; it grows 
relying on both the soil’s nutrients 
as well as moisture. 
In the same way the aggregates and elements 
and these six sense fields 
come to be because of a cause, 
and cease when the cause breaks up.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Selā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 
1. Nuns )With Vajirā ^n171 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the nun Vajirā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from almsround, she went to the Dark Forest, 
plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Vajirā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: 
“Who created this sentient being? 
Where is its maker? 
Where has the being arisen? 
And where does it cease?” 
Then the nun Vajirā thought, 
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” 
Then she thought, 
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” 
Then Vajirā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
“Why do you believe there’s such a thing as a <j>‘sentient being’? 
Māra, is this your theory? 
This is just a pile of conditions, 
you won’t find a sentient being here. 
When the parts are assembled 
we use the word ‘chariot’. 
So too, when the aggregates are present 
‘sentient being’ is the convention we use. 
But it’s only suffering that comes to be, 
lasts a while, then disappears. 
Naught but suffering comes to be, 
naught but suffering ceases.” 
Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Vajirā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. 







The Linked Discourses on Nuns are completed. 
^ck#s6(Brahmās)^cksn#s6a(1. The Appeal )The Appeal of Brahmā ^n172 So I have heard. 
At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
“This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. 
But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. 
It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. 
It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. 
And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.” 
And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha: 
“I’ve struggled hard to realize this, 
enough with trying to explain it! 
This principle is not easily understood 
by those mired in greed and hate. 
Those besotted by greed can’t see 
what’s subtle, going against the stream, 
deep, hard to see, and very fine, 
for they’re veiled in a mass of darkness.” 
And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma. 
Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, thought, 
“Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.” 
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
“Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! 
There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. 
There will be those who understand the teaching!” 
This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: 
“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past 
an impure teaching thought up by those still stained. 
Fling open the door to the deathless! 
Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered. 
Standing high on a rocky mountain, 
you can see the people all around. 
In just the same way, all-seer, wise one, 
having ascended the Temple of Truth, 
rid of sorrow, look upon the people 
swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age. 
Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, 
wander the world without obligation. 
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! 
There will be those who understand!” 
Then the Buddha, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings. 
And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. 
It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. 
In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. 
When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati: 
“Flung open are the doors to the deathless! 
Let those with ears to hear commit to faith. 
Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, <j>I did not teach 
the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.” 
Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. 
1. The Appeal )Respect ^n173 So I have heard. 
At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
“It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?” 
Then it occurred to him: 
“I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. 
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on. 
I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. 
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion … 
I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete. 
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom … 
I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete. 
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom … 
I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if it were incomplete. 
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom, who I should honor and respect and rely on. 
Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?” 
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching. 
All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching. 
May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.” 
This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: 
“All Buddhas in the past, 
the Buddhas of the future, 
and the Buddha at present—
destroyer of the sorrows of many—
respecting the true teaching 
they did live, they do live, 
and they also will live. 
This is the nature of the Buddhas. 
Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare, 
and wants to become the very best they can be, 
should respect the true teaching, 
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.” 
1. The Appeal )With Brahmadeva ^n174 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha. 
Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected. 
Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother’s home. 
Now at that time Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up a regular oblation to Brahmā. 
Then Brahmā Sahampati thought, 
“This Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to Brahmā. 
Why don’t I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?” 
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the home of Brahmadeva’s mother. 
Then Brahmā Sahampati, while standing in the air, addressed Brahmadeva’s mother in verse: 
“Far from here is the Brahmā realm, madam, 
to which you offer a regular oblation. 
But Brahmā doesn’t eat that kind of food. 
Why pray, when you don’t know the path to Brahmā? 
This Brahmadeva, madam, 
free of attachments, has surpassed the gods. 
Owning nothing, providing for no other, <j>a mendicant 
has entered your house for alms. 
He’s worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, <j>a knowledge master, evolved. 
He’s worthy of a religious donation <j>from gods and men. 
Having banished all evils, he’s unsullied. 
Cool at heart, he wanders searching for food. 
He has no before and after, 
peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, <j>with no need for hope, 
he has laid down the rod <j>for all creatures firm and frail. 
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms. 
With peaceful mind, he has left the crowd, 
he wanders like a tamed elephant, unperturbed. 
He’s a mendicant fair in ethics, with heart well freed. 
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms. 
With unwavering confidence in him, 
present your religious donation <j>to one who is worthy of it. 
Now that you’ve seen the sage who has crossed over, <j>madam, 
make merit for the sake of future happiness!” 
With unwavering confidence in him, 
she presented her religious donation <j>to one who is worthy of it. 
After seeing the sage who had crossed over, <j>the brahmin lady 
made merit for the sake of future happiness. 
1. The Appeal )With Baka the Brahmā ^n175 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: 
“This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” 
Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. 
Baka the Brahmā saw the Buddha coming off in the distance 
and said to him, 
“Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir! 
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. 
For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” 
When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him, 
“Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! 
Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. 
And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that 
there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. 
And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.” 
“Gotama, we seventy-two merit-makers <j>are now wielders of power, 
having passed beyond rebirth and old age. 
This is our last rebirth as Brahmā, knowledge master. 
And now many people pray to us.” 
“But, Baka, the life span here is short, not long, 
though you think it’s long. 
I know that your life span 
is two quinquadecillion years, Brahmā.” 
“Blessed One, I am the one of infinite vision, 
who has gone beyond rebirth and old age and sorrow. 
What precepts and observances <j>did I practice in the past? 
Explain to me so that I may understand.” 
“You gave drink to many people 
who were oppressed by thirst and heat. 
They’re the precepts and observances <j>you practiced in the past. 
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. 
When people at Deer River Bank were seized, 
you released the captives as they were led away. 
That’s the precepts and observances <j>you practiced in the past. 
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. 
When a boat on the Ganges River was seized 
by a fierce dragon desiring human flesh, 
you freed it wielding mighty force. 
That’s the precepts and observances <j>you practiced in the past. 
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. 
I used to be your servant named Kappa. 
You thought he was intelligent and loyal. 
That’s the precepts and observances <j>you practiced in the past. 
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.” 
“You certainly understand this life span of mine. 
And others, too, you know; <j>that’s why you’re the Buddha. 
And that’s why your blazing glory 
lights up even the Brahmā realm.” 
1. The Appeal )A Certain Brahmā ^n176 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time a certain Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: 
“No ascetic or brahmin can come here!” 
Then the Buddha knew what that Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. 
Then the Buddha sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. 
Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, 
“Where is the Buddha staying at present?” 
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he saw the Buddha seated cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. 
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. 
Then Mahāmoggallāna—positioning himself in the east, below the Buddha—sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. 
Then Venerable Mahākassapa … 



positioned himself in the south … 
Venerable Mahākappina … 




positioned himself in the west … 
Venerable Anuruddha … 



positioned himself in the north, below the Buddha, sitting cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. 
Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that Brahmā in verse: 
“Sir, do you still have the same view 
that you had in the past? 
Or do you see the radiance 
transcending the Brahmā realm?” 
“Good sir, I don’t have that view 
that I had in the past. 
I see the radiance 
transcending the Brahmā realm. 
So how could I say today 
that I am permanent and eternal?” 
Having inspired a sense of awe in the Brahmā, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove. 
Then that Brahmā addressed a member of his retinue, 
“Please, good sir, go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him: 
‘Moggallāna my good sir, are there any other disciples of the Buddha who have power and might 
comparable to the masters Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?’” 
“Yes, good sir,” replied that retinue member. He went to Moggallāna and asked as instructed. 


Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of Brahmā’s retinue in verse: 
“There are many disciples of the Buddha 
who have the three knowledges, 
and have attained psychic power, <j>expert in reading minds, 
they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.” 
Then that member of Brahmā’s retinue, having approved and agreed with what Mahāmoggallāna said, went to that Brahmā and said to him, 
“Good sir, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: 
‘There are many disciples of the Buddha 
who have the three knowledges, 
and have attained psychic power, <j>expert in reading minds, 
they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.’” 
That’s what that member of Brahmā’s retinue said. 
Satisfied, that Brahmā was happy with what the member of his retinue said. 
1. The Appeal )The Negligent Brahmā ^n177 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. 
Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. But Subrahmā said to Suddhāvāsa, 
“Good sir, it’s the wrong time to pay homage to the Buddha. 
He has gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. 
But such and such Brahmā realm is successful and prosperous, while the Brahmā living there is negligent. 
Come, let’s go to that Brahmā realm and inspire awe in that Brahmā!” 
“Yes, good sir,” replied Suddhāvāsa. 
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that Brahmā realm. 
That Brahmā saw those Brahmās coming off in the distance and said to them, 
“Well now, good sirs, where have you come from?” 
“Good sir, we’ve come from the presence of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?” 
When they had spoken, that Brahmā refused to accept their advice. He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā, 
“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?” 
“I see that, good sir.” 
“Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend upon?” 
Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and said to that Brahmā, 
“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?” 
“I see that, good sir.” 
“That Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or me. 
Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?” 
Then that Brahmā addressed Subrahmā in verse: 
“There are three hundreds of phoenixes, <j>four of swans, and five of eagles. 
This palace belongs to him who practiced absorption. 
It shines, Brahmā, 
lighting up the northern quarter!” 
“So what if your palace shines, 
lighting up the northern quarter? 
A clever person who has seen the deficiency in form, 
its chronic trembling, takes no pleasure in it.” 
Then after inspiring awe in that Brahmā, the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa vanished right there. 
And after some time that Brahmā went to attend on the Buddha. 
1. The Appeal )About Kokālika ^n178 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. 
Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. 
Then Subrahmā recited this verse about the mendicant Kokālika in the Buddha’s presence: 
“What wise person here would judge 
the immeasurable by measuring them? 
I think anyone who’d do such a thing 
must be an ordinary person, shrouded in darkness.” 
1. The Appeal )About Katamorakatissaka ^n179 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. 
Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. 
Then Suddhāvāsa recited this verse about the mendicant Katamorakatissaka in the Buddha’s presence: 
“What wise person here would judge 
the immeasurable by measuring them? 
I think anyone who’d do such a thing 
must be a fool, shrouded in darkness.” 
1. The Appeal )With the Brahmā Tudu ^n180 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the mendicant Kokālika was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
Then, late at night, the beautiful independent brahmā Tudu, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the mendicant Kokālika, and standing in the air he said to him, 
“Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, 
they’re good monks.” 
“Who are you, reverend?” 
“I am Tudu the independent brahmā.” 
“Didn’t the Buddha declare you a non-returner? So what exactly are you doing back here? 
See how far you have strayed!” 
“A man is born 
with an axe in his mouth. 
A fool cuts themselves with it 
when they say bad words. 
When you praise someone worthy of criticism, 
or criticize someone worthy of praise, 
you choose bad luck with your own mouth: 
you’ll never find happiness that way. 
Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, 
if all you lose is your money 
and all you own, even yourself. 
What’s really terrible luck 
is to hate the holy ones. 
For more than two quinquadecillion years, 
and another five quattuordecillion years, 
a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, 
having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.” 
1. The Appeal )With Kokālika ^n181 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.” 
When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika, 
“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! 
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” 
For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha, 
“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.” 
For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, 
“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! 
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” 
For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, 
“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.” 
For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, 
“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! 
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” 
Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. 
The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. 
Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. 
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. 
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” 
That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. 
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. 
Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. 




When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, 
“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” 
“It’s long, mendicant. 
It’s not easy to calculate 
how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” 
“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” 
“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. 
“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. 
By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. 
Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. 
Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. 
Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. 
Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. 
Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell. 
Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell. 
Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. 
Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. 
Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. 
The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“A man is born 
with an axe in his mouth. 
A fool cuts themselves with it 
when they say bad words. 
When you praise someone worthy of criticism, 
or criticize someone worthy of praise, 
you choose bad luck with your own mouth: 
you’ll never find happiness that way. 
Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, 
if all you lose is your money 
and all you own, even yourself. 
What’s really terrible luck 
is to hate the holy ones. 
For more than two quinquadecillion years, 
and another five quattuordecillion years, 
a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, 
having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.” 






^cksn#s6b(Chapter Two )With Sanaṅkumāra ^n182 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the bank of the Sappinī river. 
Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, lighting up the entire Sappinī riverbank, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The aristocrat is best among people 
who take clan as the standard. 
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct 
is best among gods and humans.” 
That’s what Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra said, 
and the teacher approved. 
Then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. 
Chapter Two )About Devadatta ^n183 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. 
Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“The banana tree is destroyed by its own fruit, 
as are the bamboo and the reed. 
Honor destroys a sinner, 
as pregnancy destroys a mule.” 
Chapter Two )At Andhakavinda ^n184 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Andhakavinda. 
Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entirety of Andhakavinda, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“One should frequent secluded lodgings, 
and practice to be released from fetters. 
If you don’t find enjoyment there, 
live in the Saṅgha, guarded and mindful. 
Walking for alms from family to family, 
with senses guarded, alert and mindful. 
One should frequent secluded lodgings, 
free of fear, freed in the fearless. 
Where dreadful serpents slither, 
where the lightning flashes and the sky thunders 
in the dark of the night; 
there meditates a mendicant, free of goosebumps. 
For this has in fact been seen by me, 
it isn’t just what the testament says. 
Within a single spiritual dispensation 
a thousand are conquerors of Death. 
And of trainees there are more than five hundred, 
and ten times ten tens; 
all are stream-enterers, 
freed from rebirth in the animal realm. 
And as for the rest of folk 
who I think have shared in merit—
I couldn’t even number them, 
for fear of speaking falsely.” 
Chapter Two )About Aruṇavatī ^n185 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī. 
There he addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Aruṇavā. 
He had a capital named Aruṇavatī. 
Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī. 
Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava. 
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, 
‘Come, brahmin, let’s go to one of the brahmā realms until it’s time for our meal.’ 
‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. 
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from Aruṇavatī and appeared in that Brahmā realm. 
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, 
‘Brahmin, teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired for that Brahmā, his assembly, and the members of his retinue.’ 
‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. 
But the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected, 
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How on earth can a disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?’ 
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, 
‘Brahmin, Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue are complaining 
that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher. 
Well then, brahmin, stir them up even more!’ 
‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible. 
And the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought, 
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!’ 
Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī, 
‘Sir, I recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha: 
“Standing in the Brahmā realm, I can make my voice heard throughout the galaxy.”’ 
‘Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin! 
Standing in the Brahmā realm, make your voice heard throughout the galaxy.’ 
‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Standing in the Brahmā realm, he recited this verse: 
‘Rouse yourselves! Try harder! 
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha! 
Crush the army of Death, 
as an elephant a hut of reeds. 
Whoever shall meditate diligently 
in this teaching and training, 
giving up transmigration through rebirths, 
will make an end of suffering.’ 
Having inspired that Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue with a sense of awe, 
as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from that Brahmā realm and appeared in Aruṇavatī. 
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants, 
‘Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a verse while standing in a Brahmā realm?’ 
‘We did, sir.’ 
‘But what exactly did you hear?’ 
‘This is what we heard, sir: 
“Rouse yourselves! Try harder! 
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha! 
Crush the army of Death, 
as an elephant a hut of reeds. 
Whoever shall meditate diligently 
in this teaching and training, 
giving up transmigration through rebirths, 
will make an end of suffering.” 
That’s what we heard, sir.’ 
‘Good, good, mendicants! 
It’s good that you heard the mendicant Abhibhū speaking this verse while standing in a Brahmā realm.’” 
That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. 
Chapter Two )Final Extinguishment ^n186 At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishment. 
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: 
“Come now, mendicants, I say to you all: 
‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’” 
These were the Realized One’s last words. 
Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling. 
Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished. 
When the Buddha became fully extinguished, along with the full extinguishment, Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse: 
“All creatures in this world 
must lay down this bag of bones. 
For even a Teacher such as this, 
unrivaled in the world, 
the Realized One, attained to power, 
the Buddha became fully extinguished.” 
When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this verse: 
“Oh! Conditions are impermanent, 
their nature is to rise and fall; 
having arisen, they cease; 
their stilling is true bliss.” 
When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse: 
“Then there was terror! 
Then they had goosebumps! 
When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities, 
became fully extinguished.” 
When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Anuruddha recited this verse: 
“There was no more breathing 
for the poised one of steady heart. 
Imperturbable, committed to peace, 
the seer became fully extinguished. 
He put up with painful feelings 
without flinching. 
The liberation of his heart 
was like the extinguishing of a lamp.” 






The Linked Discourses on Brahmā are complete. 
^ck#s7(Brahmins)^cksn#s7a(1. The Perfected Ones )With Dhanañjānī ^n187 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Now at that time a certain brahmin lady of the Bhāradvāja clan named Dhanañjānī was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. 
Once, while she was bringing her husband his meal she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: 
“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” 
When she said this, the brahmin said to Dhanañjānī: 
“That’d be right. For the slightest thing this lowlife woman spouts out praise for that bald ascetic. 
Right now, lowlife woman, I’m going to refute your teacher’s doctrine!” 
“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can refute the doctrine of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
But anyway, you should go. When you’ve gone you’ll understand.” 
Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, angry and upset, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, 
and addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease? 
When what is incinerated is there no sorrow? 
What is the one thing 
whose killing you approve?” 
“When anger’s incinerated you sleep at ease. 
When anger’s incinerated there is no sorrow. 
O brahmin, anger has a poisonous root 
and a honey tip. 
The noble ones praise its killing, 
for when it’s incinerated there is no sorrow.” 
When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the ascetic Gotama’s presence?” 
And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )The Abuser ^n188 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
The brahmin Bhāradvāja the Rude heard a rumor that 
a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words.
When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him:
“What do you think, brahmin? 
Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?” 
“Sometimes they do, Master Gotama.” 
“Do you then serve them with fresh and cooked foods and savories?” 
“Sometimes I do.” 
“But if they don’t accept it, brahmin, who does it belong to?” 
“In that case it still belongs to me.” 
“In the same way, brahmin, when you abuse, harass, and attack us who do not abuse, harass, and attack, we don’t accept it. 
It still belongs to you, brahmin, 
it still belongs to you! 
Someone who, when abused, harassed, and attacked, abuses, harasses, and attacks in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it. 
But we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it. 
It still belongs to you, brahmin, 
it still belongs to you!” 
“The king and his retinue believe that Master Gotama is 
a perfected one. 
And yet he still gets angry.” 
“For one free of anger, tamed, living in balance, 
freed by right knowledge, 
a poised one who is at peace: 
where would anger come from? 
When you get angry at an angry person 
you just make things worse for yourself. 
When you don’t get angry at an angry person 
you win a battle hard to win. 
When you know that the other is angry, 
you act for the good of both 
yourself and the other 
if you’re mindful and stay calm. 
People unfamiliar with the teaching 
consider one who heals both 
oneself and the other 
to be a fool.” 
When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja the Rude said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! … 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the ascetic Gotama’s presence?” 
And the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Rude received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja the Rude, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )With Bhāradvāja the Fiend ^n189 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
The brahmin Bhāradvāja the Fiend heard a rumor to the effect that 
a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words. 
But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent. 
Then Bhāradvāja the Fiend said to the Buddha, 
“You’re beaten, ascetic, you’re beaten!” 
“‘Ha! I won!’ thinks the fool, 
when speaking with harsh words. 
Patience is the true victory 
for those who understand. 
When you get angry at an angry person 
you just make things worse for yourself. 
When you don’t get angry at an angry person 
you win a battle hard to win. 
When you know that the other is angry, 
you act for the good of both 
yourself and the other 
if you’re mindful and stay calm. 
People unskilled in Dhamma 
consider one who heals both 
oneself and the other 
to be a fool.” 
When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja the Fiend said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” … 

And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )With Bhāradvāja the Bitter ^n190 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
The brahmin Bhāradvāja the Bitter heard a rumor that 
a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and stood silently to one side. 
Then the Buddha, knowing what Bhāradvāja the Bitter was thinking, addressed him in verse: 
“Whoever wrongs a man who has done no wrong, 
a pure man who has not a blemish, 
the evil backfires on the fool, 
like fine dust thrown upwind.” 
When he said this, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Bitter said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” … 

And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )Harmless ^n191 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Harmless went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said, 
“I am Harmless, Master Gotama, I am Harmless!” 
“If you were really like your name, 
then you’d be Harmless. 
But a truly harmless person 
does no harm by way of 
body, speech, or mind; 
they don’t harm anyone else.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Harmless said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” … 

And Venerable Bhāradvāja the Harmless became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )With Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair ^n192 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, 
and addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Tangled within, tangled without: 
these people are tangled in tangles. 
I ask you this, Gotama: 
who can untangle this tangle?” 
“A wise person grounded in ethics, 
developing the mind and wisdom, 
a keen and alert mendicant—
they can untangle this tangle. 
Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance 
have faded away; 
the perfected ones with defilements ended—
they have untangled the tangle. 
Where name and form 
cease with nothing left over; 
as well as impingement and perception of form: 
it’s there that the tangle is cut.” 
When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” … 
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )With Bhāradvāja the Pure ^n193 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Pure went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, 
and recited this verse in his presence: 
“No brahmin in the world is ever purified 
even though he’s ethical and mortifies himself. 
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct 
is purified, not these commoners.” 
“Even one who mutters many prayers 
is no brahmin by birth 
if they’re filthy and corrupt within, 
supporting themselves by fraud. 
Regardless of whether you’re an aristocrat, 
a brahmin, peasant, menial, <j>or an outcaste or scavenger—
if you’re energetic and resolute, 
always staunchly vigorous, 
you’ll attain ultimate purity. 
Know that for a fact, brahmin.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Pure said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama …” … 
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )With Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper ^n194 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Now at that time ghee and milk-rice had been set out for the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper, who thought, 
“I will serve the sacred flame! I will perform the fire sacrifice!” 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. 
Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Rājagaha, he approached Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper’s home and stood to one side. 
Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper saw him standing for alms 
and addressed him in verse: 
“One who’s accomplished in the three knowledges, 
of good lineage and ample learning, 
accomplished in knowledge and conduct 
may enjoy this milk-rice.” 
“Even one who mutters many prayers 
is no brahmin by birth 
if they’re filthy and corrupt within, 
with a following gained by fraud. 
But one who knows their past lives, 
and sees heaven and places of loss, 
and has attained the ending of rebirth, 
that sage has perfect insight. 
Because of these three knowledges 
a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges. 
Accomplished in knowledge and conduct, 
they may enjoy this milk-rice.” 
“Eat, Master Gotama! 
you are truly a brahmin.” 
“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. 
That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. 
The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. 
Since there is such a principle, brahmin, <j>that’s how they live. 
Serve with other food and drink 
the consummate one, the great hermit, 
with defilements ended and remorse stilled. 
For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” … 
And Venerable Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )With Sundarikabhāradvāja ^n195 At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarikā river. 
Now at that time the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the Sundarikā. 
Then he looked all around the four quarters, wondering, 
“Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?” 
He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head. 
Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. 
When he heard Sundarikabhāradvāja’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head. 
Sundarikabhāradvāja thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back. 
But he thought, 
“Even some brahmins are shaven. 
Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?” 
Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja went up to the Buddha, and said to him, 
“Sir, in what caste were you born?” 
“Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct; 
for any kindling can kindle a flame. 
A steadfast sage, even though from a low class family, 
is a thoroughbred checked by conscience. 
Tamed by truth, fulfilled by taming, 
a complete knowledge master <j>who has completed the spiritual journey—
that’s who a sacrificer <j>should introduce themselves to, 
and make a timely offering <j>to one worthy of a religious donation.” 
“My sacrificial offering <j>must have been well performed, 
since I have met such a knowledge master! 
It’s because I’d never met anyone like you 
that others ate the leftover offering. 
Eat, Master Gotama, 
you are truly a brahmin.” 
“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. 
That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. 
The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. 
Since there is such a principle, brahmin, <j>that’s how they live. 
Serve with other food and drink 
the consummate one, the great hermit, 
with defilements ended and remorse stilled. 
For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” 
“Then, Master Gotama, to whom should I give the leftovers of this offering?” 
“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest these leftovers, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples. 
Well then, brahmin, throw out those leftovers where there is little that grows, or drop them into water that has no living creatures.” 
So Sundarikabhāradvāja dropped the leftover offering in water that had no living creatures. 
And when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. 
Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming. 
In the same way, when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. 
Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja, shocked and awestruck, went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side. 
The Buddha addressed him in verse: 
“When you’re kindling the wood, brahmin, 
don’t imagine this is purity, for it’s just an external. 
For experts say this is no way to purity, 
when one seeks purity in externals. 
I’ve given up kindling firewood, brahmin, 
now I just light the inner flame. 
Always blazing, always serene, 
I am a perfected one leading the spiritual life. 
Conceit, brahmin, is the burden of your possessions, 
anger your smoke, and lies your ashes. 
The tongue is the ladle and the heart the fire altar; 
a well-tamed self is a person’s light. 
The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin, 
unclouded, praised by the fine to the good. 
There the knowledge masters go to bathe, 
and cross to the far shore without getting wet. 
Truth, principle, restraint, the spiritual life; 
the attainment of the supreme based on the middle, <j>brahmin. 
Pay homage to the upright ones—
I declare that man to be <j>one who follows the teaching.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama …” … 
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. 
1. The Perfected Ones )Many Daughters ^n196 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time one of the brahmins of the Bhāradvāja clan had lost fourteen oxen. 
While looking for them he went to that forest, where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in front of him. 
He went up to the Buddha, and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
“This ascetic mustn’t have 
fourteen oxen 
missing for the past six days: 
that’s why this ascetic is happy. 
This ascetic mustn’t have 
a field of sesame ruined, 
with just one or two leaves: 
that’s why this ascetic is happy. 
This ascetic mustn’t have 
rats in a vacant barn 
dancing merrily: 
that’s why this ascetic is happy. 
This ascetic mustn’t have 
carpets that for seven months 
have been infested with fleas: 
that’s why this ascetic is happy. 
This ascetic mustn’t have 
seven widowed daughters 
with one or two children each: 
that’s why this ascetic is happy. 
This ascetic mustn’t have 
a wife with sallow, blotchy skin 
to wake him with a kick: 
that’s why this ascetic is happy. 
This ascetic mustn’t have 
creditors knocking at dawn, 
warning, ‘Pay up! Pay up!’: 
that’s why this ascetic is happy.” 
“You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have 
fourteen oxen 
missing for the past six days: 
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. 
You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have 
a field of sesame ruined, 
with just one or two leaves: 
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. 
You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have 
rats in a vacant barn 
dancing merrily: 
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. 
You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have 
carpets that for seven months 
have been infested with fleas: 
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. 
You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have 
seven widowed daughters 
with one or two children each: 
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. 
You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have 
a wife with blotchy, pockmarked skin 
to wake me up with a kick: 
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. 
You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have 
creditors knocking at dawn, 
warning, ‘Pay up! Pay up!’: 
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the ascetic Gotama’s presence?” 
And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. 








^cksn#s7b(2. Lay Followers )With Bhāradvāja the Farmer ^n197 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa. 
Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working. 
Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food. 
Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side. 
Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms 
and said to him, 
“I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat. 
You too should plough and sow, then you may eat.” 
“I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.” 
“I don’t see Master Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen, yet he says: 
‘I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.’” 
Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“You claim to be a farmer, 
but I don’t see you farming. 
Tell me how you’re a farmer when asked: 
how am I to recognize your farming?” 
“Faith is my seed, fervor my rain, 
and wisdom is my yoke and plough. 
Conscience is my pole, mind my strap, 
mindfulness my plowshare and goad. 
Guarded in body and speech, 
I restrict my intake of food. 
I use truth as my scythe, 
and gentleness is my release. 
Energy is my beast of burden, 
transporting me to a place of sanctuary. 
It goes without turning back 
to where there is no sorrow. 
That’s how to do the farming 
that has the Deathless as its fruit. 
When you finish this farming 
you’re released from all suffering.” 
“Eat, Master Gotama, 
you are truly a farmer. 
For Master Gotama does the farming that has the Deathless as its fruit.” 
“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. 
That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. 
The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. 
Since there is such a principle, brahmin, <j>that’s how they live. 
Serve with other food and drink 
the consummate one, the great hermit, 
with defilements ended and remorse stilled. 
For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )With Udaya ^n198 At Sāvatthī. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Udaya. 
Then Udaya filled the Buddha’s bowl with rice. 
The next day … and the day after that … Udaya filled the Buddha’s bowl with rice. 
But when he had filled the Buddha’s bowl for a third time, he said to the Buddha, 
“This insatiable ascetic Gotama keeps coming back again and again!” 
“Again and again, they sow the seed; 
again and again, the lord god sends rain; 
again and again, farmers plough the field; 
again and again, grain is produced for the nation. 
Again and again, the beggars beg; 
again and again, the donors give. 
Again and again, when the donors have given, 
again and again, they take their place in heaven. 
Again and again, dairy farmers milk; 
again and again, a calf cleaves to its mother; 
again and again, oppressing and intimidating; 
that idiot is reborn again and again. 
Again and again, you’re reborn and die; 
again and again, you get carried to a charnel ground. 
But when they’ve gained the path <j>for no further rebirth, 
one of vast wisdom is not reborn again and again.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Udaya said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )With Devahita ^n199 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time the Buddha was afflicted by winds. 
Venerable Upavāna was his carer. 
Then the Buddha said to Upavāna, 
“Please, Upavāna, find some hot water for me.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Upavāna. He robed up, and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Devahita, and stood silently to one side. 
Devahita saw him standing there 
and addressed him in verse: 
“Silent stands the Master, 
shaven, wrapped in his outer robe. 
What do you want? What are you looking for? 
What have you come here to ask for?” 
“The perfected one, the Holy One in the world, 
the sage is afflicted by winds. 
If there’s hot water, 
give it to the sage, brahmin. 
I wish to bring it to the one 
who is esteemed by the estimable, 
honored by the honorable, 
venerated by the venerable.” 
Then Devahita had a man fetch a carrying-pole with hot water. He also presented Upavāna with a jar of molasses. 
Then Venerable Upavāna went up to the Buddha and bathed him with the hot water. Then he stirred molasses into hot water and presented it to the Buddha. 
Then the Buddha’s illness died down. 
Then the brahmin Devahita went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, 
and addressed the Buddha in verse: 
“Where should you give an available gift? 
Where is a gift very fruitful? 
How does one who is donating 
ensure the success of their religious donation?” 
“One who knows their past lives, 
and sees heaven and places of loss, 
and has attained the ending of rebirth, 
that sage has perfect insight. 
Here you should give an available gift; 
what’s given here is very fruitful. 
That’s how a sponsor of sacrifices 
ensures the success of their religious donation.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Devahita said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )A well-to-do brahmin ^n200 At Sāvatthī. 
Then a certain well-to-do brahmin, shabby, wearing a shabby cloak, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
“Brahmin, why are you so shabby, wearing a shabby cloak?” 
“Master Gotama, I have four sons. 
At their wives’ bidding they expelled me from my house.” 
“Well then, brahmin, memorize these verses and recite them to your sons when you are all seated in the council hall with a large crowd. 
‘I was overjoyed when they were born, 
and wished for them the very best. 
But at their wives’ bidding they chased me out, 
like hounds after hogs. 
It turns out they’re wicked, those nasty men, 
though they called me their dear old Dad. 
They’re monsters in the shape of sons, 
throwing me out as I’ve grown old. 
Like an old, useless horse 
led away from its fodder, 
the elderly father of those kids 
begs for alms at others’ homes. 
Even my staff is better 
than those disobedient sons, 
for it wards off a wild bull, 
and even a wild dog. 
It goes before me in the dark; 
in deep waters it supports me. 
By the wonderful power of this staff, 
when I stumble, I stand firm again.’” 
Having memorized those verses in the Buddha’s presence, the brahmin recited them to his sons when they were all seated in the council hall with a large crowd. … 




















Then the brahmin’s sons led him back home, bathed him, and each clothed him with a fine pair of garments. 
Then the brahmin, taking one pair of garments, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, we brahmins seek a fee for our teacher. 
May Master Gotama please accept my teacher’s fee!” 
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion. 
Then the well-to-do brahmin said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )Stuck-Up ^n201 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time a brahmin named Stuck-Up was residing in Sāvatthī. 
He didn’t bow to his mother or father, his teacher, or his oldest brother. 
Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
Then Stuck-Up thought, 
“The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
Why don’t I approach him? 
If he speaks to me, I’ll speak to him. 
But if he doesn’t speak, neither will I.” 
Then the brahmin Stuck-Up went up to the Buddha, and stood silently to one side. 
But the Buddha didn’t speak to him. 
Then Stuck-Up thought, 
“This ascetic Gotama knows nothing!” And he wanted to go back from there right away. 
Then the Buddha, knowing what Stuck-Up was thinking, addressed him in verse: 
“It’s not good to foster conceit 
if you want what’s good for you, brahmin. 
You should foster the goal 
which brought you here.” 
Then Stuck-Up thought, 
“The ascetic Gotama knows my mind!” He bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name: 
“Master Gotama, I am Stuck-Up! I am Stuck-Up!” 
Then that assembly was stunned: 
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
This brahmin Stuck-Up doesn’t bow to his mother or father, his teacher, or his oldest brother. 
Yet he shows such utmost devotion to the ascetic Gotama!” 
Then the Buddha said to the brahmin Stuck-Up, 
“Enough, brahmin. Get up, and take your own seat. 
For your mind has confidence in me.” 
Then Stuck-Up took his seat and said to the Buddha: 
“Regarding whom should you not be conceited? 
Who should you respect? 
Who should you esteem? 
Who is it good to venerate properly?” 
“Your mother and father, 
and also your oldest brother, 
with teacher as fourth. 
Regarding these you should not be conceited. 
They are who you should respect. 
They are who you should esteem. 
And they’re who it’s good to venerate properly. 
And when you’ve humbled conceit, <j>and aren’t stuck-up, 
show supreme reverence for 
the perfected ones, cooled, 
their task complete, free of defilements.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Stuck-Up said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )The Contraphile ^n202 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time a brahmin named Contraphile, who loved contradiction, was residing in Sāvatthī. 
Then Contraphile thought, 
“Why don’t I go to the ascetic Gotama and 
contradict everything he says?” 
At that time the Buddha was walking mindfully in the open air. 
Then the brahmin Contraphile went up to the Buddha, and said to him as he was walking, 
“Ascetic, preach the Dhamma.” 
“Fine words aren’t easy to understand 
by a lover of contradiction, 
whose mind is tainted 
and full of aggression. 
But when you’ve dispelled aggression, 
and your suspicious mind, 
and you’ve got rid of resentment, 
then you’ll understand fine words.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Contraphile said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )The Builder ^n203 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Builder was doing some building work in that jungle thicket. 
He saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in front of him. 
Seeing this, it occurred to him, 
“I enjoy doing this building work here in the jungle. 
I wonder what the ascetic Gotama enjoys doing?” 
Then Bhāradvāja the Builder went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“What kind of work do you do 
as a mendicant in the sal jungle? 
How do you find enjoyment 
alone in the wilderness, Gotama?” 
“There’s nothing I need to do in the jungle; 
my jungle’s cut down at the root, it’s withered away. 
With jungle cleared and free of thorns, 
I enjoy being alone in the jungle, <j>having given up discontent.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Builder said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )Collecting Firewood ^n204 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Then several youths, students of one of the Bhāradvāja brahmins, approached a forest grove while collecting firewood. They saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in front of him. Seeing this, they went up to Bhāradvāja and said to him, 
“Please sir, you should know this. 
In such and such a forest grove the ascetic Gotama is sitting down cross-legged, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in front of him.” 
Then Bhāradvāja together with those students went to that forest grove 
where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in front of him. 
He went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
“Deep in the jungle so full of terrors, 
you’ve plunged into the empty, desolate wilderness. 
Still, steady, and graceful: 
how beautifully you meditate, mendicant! 
Where there is no song or music, 
a lonely sage resorts to the wilderness. 
This strikes me as an amazing thing, 
that you dwell so joyfully alone in the jungle. 
I suppose you wish to be reborn in the company 
of the supreme sovereign <j>of the heaven of the Three and Thirty. 
Is that why you resort to the desolate wilderness, 
to practice fervor for attaining Brahmā?” 
“Any wishes and hopes that are always attached 
to the many and various realms—
the yearnings sprung from the root of unknowing—
I’ve eliminated them all down to the root. 
So I’m wishless, unattached, disengaged; 
amongst all things, my vision is clear. 
I’ve attained the state of grace, <j>the supreme awakening; 
I meditate alone, brahmin, and self-assured.” 
When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )The Brahmin Who Provided for His Mother ^n205 At Sāvatthī. 
Then a brahmin who provided for his mother went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, 
“Master Gotama, I seek alms by legitimate means, which I use to provide for my mother and father. 
In doing so, am I doing my duty?” 
“Indeed, brahmin, in so doing you are doing your duty. 
Whoever seeks alms by legitimate means, and uses them to provide for their mother and father makes much merit. 
A mortal provides for their mother 
and father by legitimate means; 
because they look after 
their parents like this, 
they’re praised in this life by the astute, 
and they depart to rejoice in heaven.” 
When he said this, the brahmin who provided for his mother said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )A Beggar ^n206 At Sāvatthī. 
Then a begging brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, 
“Master Gotama, both you and I are beggars. What, then, is the difference between us?” 
“You don’t become a beggar 
just by begging from others. 
One who has undertaken domestic duties 
has not yet become a mendicant. 
But one living a spiritual life 
who has banished both merit and evil, 
and wanders having assessed the world, 
is said to be a mendicant.” 
When he had spoken, the begging brahmin said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )With Saṅgārava ^n207 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time there was a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī. He practiced purification by water, believing in purification by water. He lived committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk. 
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, there is a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī. He practices purification by water, believing in purification by water. He lives committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk. 
Please visit him at his home out of compassion.” 
The Buddha consented with silence. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Saṅgārava, and sat down on the seat spread out. 
Then the brahmin Saṅgārava went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
“Is it really true, brahmin, that you practice purification by water, believing in purification by water; that you live committed to the practice of immersing yourself in water at dawn and dusk?” 
“Yes, Master Gotama.” 
“But brahmin, for what reason do you practice purification by water?” 
“It’s because, Master Gotama, whatever bad deeds I’ve done during the day I wash off by bathing at dusk; and whatever bad deeds I’ve done during the night, I wash off by bathing at dawn. 
That’s the reason why I practice purification by water.” 
“The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin, 
unclouded, praised by the fine to the good. 
There the knowledge masters go to bathe, 
and cross to the far shore without getting wet.” 
When he had spoken, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2. Lay Followers )At Khomadussa ^n208 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Khomadussa. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Khomadussa for alms. 
Now at that time the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa were gathered in the council hall for some business, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
Then the Buddha approached that council. 
The brahmins and householders saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, 
and said, 
“Who are these shavelings, these fake ascetics? Don’t they understand the council rules?” 
Then the Buddha addressed the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa in verse: 
“If good people are not present it is no true council; 
and those whose speak against principle <j>are not good people. 
Having given up greed, hate, and delusion, 
speakers of principle are good people.” 
When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 








The Linked Discourses with Brahmins are complete. 
^ck#s8(Vaṅgīsa)^cksn#s8a(1. With Vaṅgīsa )Renounced ^n209 So I have heard. 
At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa. 
Now at that time Vaṅgīsa was junior, recently gone forth. He had been left behind to look after the dwelling. 
Then several women dressed in all their finery went to the monastery at Aggāḷava in order to inspect the dwelling. 
When Vaṅgīsa saw them he became dissatisfied, with lust infecting his mind. 
Then he thought, 
“It’s my loss, my misfortune, 
that I’ve become dissatisfied, with lust infecting my mind. How is it possible for someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction? 
Why don’t I do it myself?” 
Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise to satisfaction, he recited these verses: 
“Now that I’ve renounced 
the home life for homelessness 
I’m overrun 
by the rude thoughts of the Dark One. 
Even if a thousand mighty princes and great archers, 
well trained, with strong bows, 
were to completely surround me; 
I would never flee. 
And even if women come, 
many more than that, 
they won’t scare me, 
for I stand firm in the teaching. 
I heard this with my own ears 
from the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun, 
about the path going to extinguishment; 
that’s what delights my mind. 
Wicked One, if you come near me 
as I meditate like this, 
I’ll make sure that you, Death, 
won’t even see the path I take.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )Dissatisfaction ^n210 At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa. 
Now at that time after Venerable Nigrodhakappa had finished his meal, on his return from almsround, he would enter his dwelling and not emerge for the rest of that day, or the next. 
And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as lust infected his mind. 
Then he thought, 
“It’s my loss, my misfortune, 
that I’ve become dissatisfied, with lust infecting my mind. How is it possible for someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction? 
Why don’t I do it myself?” 
Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise to satisfaction, he recited these verses: 
“Giving up discontent and desire, 
along with all thoughts of the lay life, 
they wouldn’t get entangled in anything; 
unentangled, undesiring: that’s a real mendicant. 
Whether on this earth or in the sky, 
whatever in the world is included in form 
wears out, it is all impermanent; 
the thoughtful live having comprehended this truth. 
People are bound to their attachments, 
to what is seen, heard, felt, and thought. 
Unstirred, dispel desire for these things; 
for one called ‘a sage’ does not cling to them. 
Attached to the sixty wrong views, <j>and full of their own opinions, 
ordinary people are fixed in wrong principles. 
But that mendicant wouldn’t join a sectarian group, 
still less would they utter lewd speech. 
Clever, long serene, 
free of deceit, alert, without envy, 
the sage has reached the state of peace; 
and because he’s extinguished, he bides his time.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )Good-Hearted ^n211 At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa. 
Now at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa looked down upon other good-hearted mendicants because of his own poetic virtuosity. 
Then he thought, 
“It’s my loss, my misfortune, 
that I look down on other good-hearted mendicants because of my own poetic virtuosity.” 
Then, on the occasion of arousing remorse in himself, he recited these verses: 
“Give up conceit, Gotama! 
Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit! 
Besotted with the different kinds of conceit, 
you’ve had regrets for a long time. 
Smeared by smears and slain by conceit, 
people fall into hell. 
When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell, 
they grieve for a long time. 
But a mendicant who practices rightly, 
winner of the path, never grieves. 
They enjoy happiness and a good reputation, 
and they rightly call him a ‘Seer of Truth’. 
So don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic, 
with hindrances given up, be pure. 
Then with conceit given up completely, 
use knowledge to make an end, and be at peace.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )With Ānanda ^n212 At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms with Venerable Vaṅgīsa as his second monk. 
And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as lust infected his mind. 
Then he addressed Ānanda in verse: 
“I’ve got a burning desire for pleasure; 
My mind is on fire! 
Please, out of compassion, Gotama, 
tell me how to quench the flames.” 
“Your mind is on fire 
because of a perversion of perception. 
Turn away from the feature of things 
that’s attractive, provoking lust. 
See all conditioned phenomena as other, 
as suffering and not-self. 
Extinguish the great fire of lust, 
don’t burn up again and again. 
With mind unified and serene, 
meditate on the ugly aspects of the body. 
With mindfulness immersed in the body, 
be full of disillusionment. 
Meditate on the signless, 
give up the underlying tendency to conceit; 
and when you comprehend conceit, 
you will live at peace.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )Well-Spoken Words ^n213 At Sāvatthī. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people. 
What four? 
It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely. 
Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“Good people say well-spoken words are foremost; 
second, speak on the teaching, not against it; 
third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; 
and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely.” 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: 
“Speak only such words 
as do not hurt yourself 
nor harm others; 
such speech is truly well spoken. 
Speak only pleasing words, 
words gladly welcomed. 
Pleasing words are those 
that bring nothing bad to others. 
Truth itself is the undying word: 
this is an eternal truth. 
Good people say that the teaching and its meaning 
are grounded in the truth. 
The words spoken by the Buddha 
for realizing the sanctuary, extinguishment, 
for making an end of suffering: 
this really is the best kind of speech.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )With Sāriputta ^n214 At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, and expressed the meaning. 
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, 
“This Venerable Sāriputta is educating the mendicants. … 
And those mendicants are paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?” 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward Sāriputta, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Reverend Sāriputta! I feel inspired to speak, Reverend Sāriputta!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said Sāriputta. 
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Sāriputta in his presence with fitting verses: 
“Deep in wisdom, intelligent, 
expert in the variety of paths; 
Sāriputta, so greatly wise, 
teaches Dhamma to the mendicants. 
He teaches in brief, 
or he speaks at length. 
His call, like a myna bird, 
overflows with inspiration. 
While he teaches 
the mendicants listen to his sweet voice, 
sounding attractive, 
clear and graceful. 
They listen joyfully, 
their hearts elated.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )The Invitation to Admonish ^n215 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred monks, all of whom were perfected ones. 
Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish. 
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were silent. He addressed them: 
“Come now, monks, I invite you all: 
Is there anything I’ve done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” 
When he had spoken, Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
“There is nothing, sir, that you’ve done by way of body or speech that we would criticize. 
For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path. 
And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later. 
And sir, I invite the Blessed One. 
Is there anything I’ve done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” 
“There is nothing, Sāriputta, that you’ve done by way of body or speech that I would criticize. 
Sāriputta, you are astute. You have great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, penetrating wisdom. 
A wheel-turning monarch’s oldest son rightly keeps wielding the power set in motion by his father. 
In the same way, Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by me.” 
“Since it seems I have done nothing worthy of the Blessed One’s criticism, 
is there anything these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” 
“There is nothing, Sāriputta, that these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that I would criticize. 
For of these five hundred monks, sixty have the three knowledges, sixty have the six direct knowledges, sixty are freed both ways, and the rest are freed by wisdom.” 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: 
“Today, on the fifteenth day sabbath, 
five hundred monks have gathered together <j>to purify their precepts. 
These untroubled sages <j>have cut off their fetters and bonds, 
they will not be reborn again. 
Just as a wheel-turning monarch 
surrounded by ministers 
travels all around this 
land that’s girt by sea. 
So disciples with the three knowledges, 
conquerors of death, 
revere the winner of the battle, 
the unsurpassed caravan leader. 
All are sons of the Blessed One—
there is no rubbish here. 
I bow to the kinsman of the Sun, 
destroyer of the dart of craving.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )Over a Thousand ^n216 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. 
Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. 
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, 
“The Buddha is educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. 
And those mendicants are paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?” 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: 
“Over a thousand mendicants 
revere the Holy One 
as he teaches the immaculate Dhamma, 
extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter. 
They listen to the immaculate Dhamma 
taught by the fully awakened Buddha; 
the Buddha is so brilliant, 
at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha, 
Blessed One, your name is ‘Giant’, 
seventh of the sages. 
You are like a great cloud 
that rains on your disciples. 
I’ve left my day’s meditation, 
out of desire to see the teacher. 
Great hero, your disciple Vaṅgīsa 
bows at your feet.” 
“Vaṅgīsa, had you previously composed these verses, or did they spring to mind in the moment?” 
“They sprang to mind in the moment, sir.” 
“Well then, Vaṅgīsa, speak some more spontaneously inspired verses.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Vaṅgīsa. Then he extolled the Buddha with some more spontaneously inspired verses, not previously composed: 
“Having overcome Māra’s devious path, 
you wander with hard-heartedness dissolved. 
See him, the liberator from bonds, unattached, 
analyzing the teaching. 
You have explained in many ways 
the path to cross the flood. 
The Seers of Truth stand unfaltering 
in the deathless you’ve explained. 
As the bringer of light who has pierced the truth, 
you’ve seen what lies beyond all realms. 
When you saw and realized this for yourself, 
you taught it first to the group of five. 
When the Dhamma has been so well taught, 
how could those who know it be negligent? 
That’s why, being diligent, we should always train 
respectfully in the Buddha’s teaching.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )With Koṇḍañña ^n217 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Then Venerable Koṇḍañña Who Understood approached the Buddha after a very long absence. He bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name: 
“I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am Koṇḍañña, Holy One!” 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, 
“This Venerable Koṇḍañña Who Understood has approached the Buddha after a very long absence. He bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name: 
‘I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am Koṇḍañña, Holy One!’ 
Why don’t I extoll him in the Buddha’s presence with fitting verses?” 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Koṇḍañña in the Buddha’s presence with fitting verses: 
“The senior monk who was awakened <j>right after the Buddha, 
Koṇḍañña, is keenly energetic. 
He regularly gains blissful meditative states, 
and the three kinds of seclusion. 
Whatever can be attained by a disciple 
who does the Teacher’s bidding, 
he has attained it all, 
through diligently training himself. 
With great power and the three knowledges, 
expert in comprehending the minds of others, 
Koṇḍañña, the heir to the Buddha, 
bows at the Teacher’s feet.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )With Moggallāna ^n218 At one time the Buddha was staying on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants, all of whom were perfected ones. 
Thereupon, with his mind, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna checked to see whose mind was liberated and free of attachments. 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, 
“The Buddha is staying on the slopes of Isigili … with five hundred perfected ones. 
Mahāmoggallāna is checking to see whose mind is liberated and free of attachments. 
Why don’t I extoll him in the Buddha’s presence with fitting verses?” 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Mahāmoggallāna in his presence with fitting verses: 
“As the sage, who has gone beyond suffering, 
sits upon the mountain slope, 
he is revered by disciples with the three knowledges, 
conquerors of death. 
Moggallāna, of great psychic power, 
comprehends with his mind, 
scrutinizing their minds, 
liberated, free of attachments. 
So they revere Gotama, 
the sage gone beyond suffering, 
who is endowed with all path factors, 
and with a multitude of attributes.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )At Gaggarā ^n219 At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants, seven hundred male and seven hundred female lay followers, and many thousands of deities. 
But the Buddha outshone them all in beauty and glory. 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, 
“The Buddha is staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants, seven hundred male and seven hundred female lay followers, and many thousands of deities. 
And he outshines them all in beauty and glory. 
Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?” 
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: 
“Like the moon on a cloudless night, 
like the shining immaculate sun, 
so too Aṅgīrasa, O great sage, 
your glory outshines the entire world.” 
1. With Vaṅgīsa )With Vaṅgīsa ^n220 At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time Vaṅgīsa had recently attained perfection. While experiencing the bliss of freedom, on that occasion he recited these verses: 
“We used to wander, drunk on poetry, 
village to village, town to town. 
Then we saw the Buddha, 
and faith arose in us. 
He taught me Dhamma: 
the aggregates, sense fields, and elements. 
When I heard his teaching 
I went forth to homelessness. 
It was truly for the benefit of many 
that the sage achieved awakening—
for the monks and for the nuns 
who see that they’ve reached certainty. 
It was so welcome for me 
to be in the presence of the Buddha. 
I’ve attained the three knowledges, 
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. 
I know my past lives, 
my clairvoyance is purified, 
I am master of three knowledges, <j>attained in psychic power, 
expert in comprehending the minds of others.” 








The Linked Discourses with Vaṅgīsa are complete. 
^ck#s9(Woods)^cksn#s9a(1. In the Woods )Seclusion ^n221 So I have heard. 
At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time that mendicant, during their day’s meditation, was thinking bad, unskillful thoughts to do with the lay life. 
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
“You entered the woods desiring seclusion, 
yet your mind strays to outward things. 
As a person, you should dispel the desire for people. 
Then you’ll be happy, free of greed. 
Mindful, give up discontent; 
let us remind you of the way of the good. 
The dusty abyss is so hard to cross; 
don’t let sensual dust drag you down. 
Just as a bird strewn with dirt 
sheds that clingy dust with a shake; 
so too, an energetic, mindful mendicant 
sheds that clingy dust with a shake.” 
Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency. 
1. In the Woods )Getting Up ^n222 At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time that mendicant fell asleep during the day’s meditation. 
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
“Get up, mendicant! Why lie down? 
What’s the point in sleeping? 
How can the afflicted slumber 
when injured by an arrow strike? 
You should amplify the faith 
that led you to go forth 
from the home life to homelessness. 
Don’t fall under the sway of slumber.” 
“Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable, 
but idiots still fall for them. 
Among those who are bound, <j>they’re free and unattached: 
why bother a renunciate? 
By removing desire and greed, 
by going beyond ignorance, 
that knowledge has been perfectly cleansed: 
why bother a renunciate? 
By breaking ignorance with knowledge, 
by the ending of defilements, 
they’re sorrowless, unstressed: 
why bother a renunciate? 
Energetic, resolute, 
always staunchly vigorous, 
aspiring to extinguishment: 
why bother a renunciate?” 
1. In the Woods )With Kassapagotta ^n223 At one time Venerable Kassapagotta was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time Venerable Kassapagotta, having withdrawn for his day’s meditation, tried to advise a tribal hunter. 
Then the deity haunting that forest approached Kassapagotta wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: 
“A tribal hunter wandering the rugged hills 
is unintelligent, unthinking. 
It’s a waste of time to advise him; 
this mendicant seems to me like an idiot. 
The tribal hunter listens without understanding, 
he looks without seeing. 
Though the teaching is spoken, 
the fool doesn’t get it. 
Even if you lit ten lamps 
and brought them to him, Kassapa, 
he wouldn’t see anything, 
for he has no eyes to see.” 
Impelled by that deity, Venerable Kassapagotta was struck with a sense of urgency. 
1. In the Woods )Several Mendicants Set Out Wandering ^n224 At one time several mendicants were staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Then after completing the three months of the rainy season residence, those mendicants set out wandering. 
Not seeing those mendicants, the deity haunting that forest cried. And on that occasion they recited this verse: 
“Seeing so many vacated seats today, 
it seems to me they must have become dissatisfied. 
They were so learned, such brilliant speakers! 
Where have these disciples of Gotama gone?” 
When they had spoken, another deity replied with this verse: 
“They’ve gone to Magadha, they’ve gone to Kosala, 
and some are in the Vajjian lands. 
Like deer that wander free of ties, 
the mendicants live with no abode.” 
1. In the Woods )With Ānanda ^n225 At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time Ānanda was spending too much time informing the lay people. 
Then the deity haunting that forest had compassion for Ānanda, wanting what’s best for him. So they approached him wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: 
“You’ve left for the jungle, the root of a tree, 
with quenching in your heart. 
Practice absorption, Gotama, don’t be negligent! 
What is this hullabaloo to you?” 
Impelled by that deity, Venerable Ānanda was struck with a sense of urgency. 
1. In the Woods )With Anuruddha ^n226 At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Then a certain deity of the company of the Thirty-Three named Penelope had been Anuruddha’s partner in a former life. She went up to Anuruddha, and recited these verses: 
“Set your heart there, 
where you used to live; 
among the gods of the Thirty-Three, 
whose every desire is granted! 
At the fore of a retinue 
of divine maidens, you’ll shine!” 
“Divine maidens are in a sorry state, 
stuck in self-identity. 
And those beings too are in a sorry state, 
who are attached to divine maidens.” 
“They don’t know pleasure 
who don’t see the Garden of Delight! 
It’s the abode of lordly gods, 
the glorious host of Thirty!” 
“Fool, don’t you understand 
the saying of the perfected ones: 
all conditions are impermanent, 
their nature is to rise and fall; 
having arisen, they cease; 
their stilling is true bliss. 
Penelope, weaver of the web, 
there’ll be no more lives in the hosts of gods. 
Transmigration through births is finished, 
now there’ll be no more future lives.” 
1. In the Woods )With Nāgadatta ^n227 At one time Venerable Nāgadatta was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time Venerable Nāgadatta had been entering the village too early and returning late in the day. 
Then the deity haunting that forest had compassion for Nāgadatta, wanting what’s best for him. So they approached him wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: 
“Entering too early, 
and returning after spending too much of the day, 
Nāgadatta socializes with lay people, 
sharing their joys and sorrows. 
I’m afraid for Nāgadatta; he’s so reckless 
in his attachment to families. 
May he not come under the King of Death’s power, 
under the sway of the terminator!” 
Impelled by that deity, Venerable Nāgadatta was struck with a sense of urgency. 
1. In the Woods )The Mistress of the House ^n228 At one time one of the monks was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time that monk had become too closely involved in the affairs of a certain family. 
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that monk, wanting what’s best for him. So, wanting to stir him up, they manifested in the appearance of the mistress of that family, approached the monk, and addressed him in verse: 
“On the banks of the rivers and in the guest houses, 
in meeting halls and highways, 
people come together and gossip: 
what’s going on between you and me?” 
“There are lots of annoying sounds 
that an austere ascetic must endure. 
But they mustn’t be dismayed by that, 
for that’s not what defiles you. 
If you’re startled by every little sound, 
like a wind-deer in the wood, 
they’ll call you ‘flighty minded’; 
and your practice won’t succeed.” 
1. In the Woods )A Vajji ^n229 At one time a certain Vajjian mendicant was staying near Vesālī in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time the Vajjis were holding an all-night event in Vesālī. 
Then that mendicant, groaning at the noise of musical instruments being beaten and played, on that occasion recited this verse: 
“We dwell alone in the wilderness, 
like a cast-off log in the forest. 
On a night like this, 
who’s worse off than me?” 
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
“You dwell alone in the wilderness, 
like a cast-off log in the forest. 
Lots of people are jealous of you, 
like beings in hell of those going to heaven.” 
Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency. 
1. In the Woods )Recitation ^n230 At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time that mendicant had previously been spending too much time in recitation. But some time later they adhered to passivity and silence. 
Not hearing the teaching, the deity haunting that forest approached that mendicant, and addressed them in verse: 
“Mendicant, why don’t you recite <j>passages of the teaching, 
living together with other mendicants? 
When you hear the teaching confidence grows; 
and the reciter is praised in the present life.” 
“I used to be enthusiastic about <j>passages of the teaching, 
so long as I’d not realized dispassion. 
But then I realized dispassion, which the good call 
the laying to rest by completely understanding 
whatever is seen, heard, and thought.” 
1. In the Woods )Unskillful Thoughts ^n231 At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time that mendicant, during their day’s meditation, was thinking bad, unskillful thoughts, that is: 
sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. 
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
“Because of improper attention, 
you’re consumed by your thoughts. 
When you’ve given up irrationality, 
make sure your thoughts are rational. 
Thinking about the Teacher, the teaching, 
the Saṅgha, and your own ethics, 
you’ll find gladness, 
and rapture and bliss as well, no doubt. 
And when you’re full of joy, 
you’ll make an end to suffering.” 
Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency. 
1. In the Woods )Midday ^n232 At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
The deity haunting that forest approached that mendicant and recited this verse in their presence: 
“In the still of high noon, 
when the birds have settled down, 
the formidable jungle whispers to itself: 
that seems so scary to me!” 
“In the still of high noon, 
when the birds have settled down, 
the formidable jungle whispers to itself: 
that seems so delightful to me!” 
1. In the Woods )Undisciplined Faculties ^n233 At one time several mendicants were staying in the Kosalan lands in a certain forest grove. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. 
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for those mendicants, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached those mendicants wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
“The mendicants used to live happily, 
as disciples of Gotama. 
Desireless they sought alms; 
desireless they used their lodgings. 
Knowing that the world was impermanent 
they made an end of suffering. 
But now they’ve made themselves hard to look after, 
like chiefs in a village. 
They eat and eat and then lie down, 
unconscious in the homes of others. 
Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha, 
I speak here only about certain people. 
They’re rejects, with no protector, 
just like those who have passed away. 
I’m speaking about 
those who live negligently. 
To those who live diligently 
I pay homage.” 
Impelled by that deity, those mendicants were struck with a sense of urgency. 
1. In the Woods )The Thief of Scent ^n234 At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
Now at that time, after the meal, on their return from almsround, that mendicant plunged into a lotus pond and sniffed a pink lotus. 
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
“This water flower has not been given. 
When you sniff it, 
this is one factor of theft. 
Good sir, you are a thief of scent!” 
“I do not take, nor do I break; 
I sniff the water flower from afar. 
So based on what evidence 
do you call me a thief of scent? 
Why don’t you accuse someone 
who does such vandalizing 
as digging up the roots, 
or breaking off the flowers?” 
“I have nothing to say 
to a person who is a crude vandal, 
soiled like a used nappy. 
You’re the one who deserves to be spoken to. 
To the man who has not a blemish 
who is always seeking purity, 
even a hair-tip of evil 
seems as big as a cloud.” 
“Indeed, O spirit, you understand me, 
and you empathize with me. 
Please speak to me again, 
whenever you see something like this.” 
“I’m no dependent of yours, 
nor am I your servant. 
You yourself should know, mendicant, 
the way that leads to a good place.” 
Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency. 










The Linked Discourses in the Forest are completed. 
^ck#s10(Spirits)^cksn#s10a(1. With Indaka )With Indaka ^n235 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Mount Indra’s Peak, the haunt of the native spirit Indaka. 
Then the native spirit Indaka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him in verse: 
“The Buddhas say that form is not the soul. 
Then how does this body manifest? 
Where do the bones and liver come from? 
And how does one cling on in the womb?” 
“First there’s a drop of coagulate; 
from there a little bud appears; 
next it becomes a piece of flesh; 
which produces a swelling. 
From that swelling the limbs appear, 
the head hair, body hair, and teeth. 
And whatever the mother eats—
the food and drink that she consumes—
nourishes them there, 
the person in the mother’s womb.” 
1. With Indaka )With a Spirit Named Sakka ^n236 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
Then a spirit named Sakka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him in verse: 
“You’ve given up all ties, 
and are fully freed. 
It’s not a good idea for you, ascetic, 
to be instructing others.” 
“No matter what the apparent reason 
why people are together, Sakka, 
it’s unworthy for a wise person 
to not think of the other with compassion. 
If you instruct others 
with a mind clear and confident, 
your compassion and empathy 
don’t create attachments.” 
1. With Indaka )With Spiky ^n237 At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on the cut-stone ledge in the haunt of Spiky the native spirit. 
Now at that time the native spirits Shaggy and Spiky were passing by not far from the Buddha. 
So Shaggy said to Spiky, 
“That’s an ascetic.” 
“That’s no ascetic, he’s a faker! 
I’ll soon find out whether he’s an ascetic or a faker.” 
Then Spiky went up to the Buddha and leaned up against his body, 
but the Buddha pulled away. 
Then Spiky said to the Buddha, 
“Are you afraid, ascetic?” 
“No, sir, I’m not afraid. 
But your touch is nasty.” 
“I will ask you a question, ascetic. 
If you don’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges!” 
“I don’t see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans who could do that to me. 
But anyway, ask what you wish.” 
“Where do greed and hate come from? 
From where spring discontent, desire, and terror? 
Where do the mind’s thoughts originate, 
like a crow let loose by boys.” 
“Greed and hate come from here; 
from here spring discontent, desire, and terror; 
here’s where the mind’s thoughts originate, 
like a crow let loose by boys. 
Born of affection, originating in oneself, 
like the shoots from a banyan’s trunk; 
the many kinds of attachment to sensual pleasures 
are like camel’s foot creeper <j>creeping through the woods. 
Those who understand where they come from 
get rid of them—listen up, spirit! 
They cross this flood so hard to cross, 
not crossed before, so as to not be reborn.” 
1. With Indaka )With Maṇibhadda ^n238 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Maṇimālika Tree-shrine, the haunt of the native spirit Maṇibhadda. 
Then the native spirit Maṇibhadda went up to the Buddha, and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“It’s always auspicious for the mindful; 
the mindful prosper in happiness. 
Each new day is better for the mindful, 
and they’re freed from enmity.” 
“It’s always auspicious for the mindful; 
the mindful prosper in happiness. 
Each new day is better for the mindful, 
but they’re not freed from enmity. 
But someone whose mind delights in harmlessness, 
all day and all night, 
with love for all living creatures—
they have no enmity for anyone.” 
1. With Indaka )With Sānu ^n239 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time a certain lay woman had a son named Sānu who had been possessed by a native spirit. 
And as that lay woman wept, on that occasion she recited these verses: 
“I have heard this from the perfected ones. 
The native spirits will not mess with anyone 
who leads the spiritual life 
by observing the sabbath 
complete in all eight factors 
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days, 
and the eighth day of the fortnight, 
as well as on the fortnight of special displays. 
But now today I see 
native spirits messing with Sānu.” 
“What you heard from the perfected ones is right. 
The native spirits will not mess with anyone 
who leads the spiritual life 
by observing the sabbath 
complete in all eight factors 
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days, 
and the eighth day of the fortnight, 
as well as on the fortnight of special displays. 
When Sānu regains consciousness tell him 
this saying of the native spirits: 
Don’t do bad deeds 
either openly or in secret. 
If you should do a bad deed, 
or you’re doing one now, 
you won’t be freed from suffering, 
though you fly away and flee.” 
“Mum, they cry for the dead, 
or for one who’s alive but has disappeared. 
I’m alive and you can see me, 
so mum, why do you weep for me?” 
“Son, they cry for the dead, 
or for one who’s alive but has disappeared. 
But someone who has given up sensual pleasures 
only to come back here again: 
they cry for them as well, 
for though still alive they’re really dead. 
My dear, you’ve been rescued from hot coals, 
and you want to plunge right back in them! 
My dear, you’ve been rescued from the abyss, 
and you want to plunge right back there! 
Keep pushing forward, it’s what’s best for you! 
Who have I got to complain to? 
When your things have been saved from a fire, 
would you want them to be burnt again?” 
1. With Indaka )With Piyaṅkara ^n240 At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time Venerable Anuruddha rose at the crack of dawn and recited passages of the teaching. 
Then the native spirit Piyaṅkara’s Mother soothed her little child, saying: 
“Don’t make a sound, Piyaṅkara! 
A mendicant recites passages of the teaching. 
When we understand a passage, 
we can practice for our welfare. 
Let us keep from harming living creatures, 
and speak no lying words. 
We should train ourselves well in ethics, 
and hopefully we’ll be freed from the goblin realm.” 
1. With Indaka )With Punabbasu ^n241 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. 
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
Then the native spirit Punabbasu’s Mother soothed her little children, saying: 
“Hush, little Uttarā! 
Hush, Punabbasu! 
For I want to listen to the teaching 
of the Teacher, the supreme Buddha. 
Since the Blessed One spoke of extinguishment, 
the release from all ties, 
I have a lasting love 
for this teaching. 
In this world, your own child is dear; 
in this world, your own husband is dear; 
but even greater than that is my love 
for this teaching’s quest. 
For neither son nor husband, 
dear as they are, can free you from suffering; 
as listening to the true teaching 
frees living creatures from suffering. 
In this world mired in suffering, 
fettered by old age and death, 
I want to listen to the teaching 
that the Buddha awakened to, 
which frees you from old age and death. 
So hush, Punabbasu!” 
“Mom, I’m not speaking, 
and Uttarā is silent, too. 
Focus just on the teaching, 
for it’s nice to listen to the true teaching. 
And it’s because we haven’t understood the teaching 
that we live in suffering, Mom. 
He is a beacon for those who are lost 
among gods and humans. 
The Buddha, bearing his final body, 
the Seer teaches Dhamma.” 
“It’s good that my child’s so astute, 
this child I bore and suckled! 
My child loves the pure teaching 
of the supreme Buddha. 
Punabbasu, may you be happy! 
Today, I rise. 
Hear me too, Uttarā: 
I have seen the noble truths!” 
1. With Indaka )With Sudatta ^n242 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Cool Grove. 
Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had arrived at Rājagaha on some business. 
He heard 
a rumor that a Buddha had arisen in the world. 
Right away he wanted to go and see the Buddha, but he thought, 
“It’s too late to go and see the Buddha today. 
I’ll go and see him tomorrow.” He went to bed thinking of the Buddha. 
During the night he got up three times thinking it was morning. 
Then he approached the Sivaka Gate, 
and non-human beings opened it for him. 
But as he was leaving the city, light vanished and darkness appeared to him. He felt fear, terror, and goosebumps, and wanted to turn back. 
Then the invisible spirit Sivaka called out: 
“A hundred elephants, a hundred horses, 
a hundred mule-drawn chariots, 
a hundred thousand maidens 
bedecked with jeweled earrings: 
these are not worth a sixteenth part 
of a single forward stride! 
Forward, householder! 
Forward, householder! 
Going forward is better for you, 
not turning back!” 
Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika. His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down. 
But for a second time, light vanished and darkness appeared to him. … 
For a second time the invisible spirit Sivaka called out … 





“… Going forward is better for you, 
not turning back!” 
Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika. His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down. 
But for a third time, light vanished and darkness appeared to him. … 
For a third time the invisible spirit Sivaka called out … 





“… Going forward is better for you, 
not turning back!” 
Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika. His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down. 
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went to the Cool Grove and approached the Buddha. 
Now at that time the Buddha had risen at the crack of dawn and was walking mindfully in the open. 
He saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming off in the distance. 
So he stepped down from the walking path, sat down on the seat spread out, 
and said to Anāthapiṇḍika, 
“Come, Sudatta.” 
Then Anāthapiṇḍika thought, “The Buddha calls me by name!” Smiling and elated, he bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said to him, 
“Sir, I trust the Buddha slept well?” 
“A brahmin who is fully extinguished 
always sleeps at ease. 
Sensual pleasures slip off them, 
they’re cooled, free of attachments. 
Since they’ve cut off all clinging, 
and removed the stress from the heart, 
the peaceful sleep at ease, 
having found peace of mind.” 
1. With Indaka )With the Nun Sukkā (1st) ^n243 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Now, at that time the nun Sukkā was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
Then a native spirit was so devoted to Sukkā that he went from street to street and from square to square, and on that occasion recited these verses: 
“What’s up with these people in Rājagaha? 
They sleep like they’ve been drinking mead! 
They don’t attend on Sukkā 
as she’s teaching the deathless state. 
But the wise—
it’s as if they drink it up, 
so irresistible, delicious, and nutritious, 
like travelers enjoying a cool cloud.” 
1. With Indaka )With the Nun Sukkā (2nd) ^n244 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Now at that time a certain lay follower gave food to the nun Sukkā. 
Then a native spirit was so devoted to Sukkā that he went from street to street and from square to square, and on that occasion recited these verses: 
“O! He has made so much merit! 
That lay follower is so very wise. 
He just gave food to Sukkā, 
who is released from all ties.” 
1. With Indaka )With the Nun Cīrā ^n245 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Now at that time a certain lay follower gave a robe to the nun Cīrā. 
Then a native spirit was so devoted to Cīrā that he went from street to street and from square to square, and on that occasion recited these verses: 
“O! He has made so much merit! 
That lay-follower is so very wise. 
He gave a robe to Cīrā, 
who is released from all bonds.” 
1. With Indaka )With Āḷavaka ^n246 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī in the haunt of the native spirit Āḷavaka. 
Then the native spirit Āḷavaka went up to the Buddha, and said to him: 
“Get out, ascetic!” 
Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went out. 
“Get in, ascetic!” 
Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went in. 
And for a second time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the Buddha, 
“Get out, ascetic!” 
Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went out. 
“Get in, ascetic!” 
Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went in. 
And for a third time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the Buddha, 
“Get out, ascetic!” 
Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went out. 
“Get in, ascetic!” 
Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went in. 
And for a fourth time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the Buddha, 
“Get out, ascetic!” 
“No, sir, I won’t get out. 
Do what you must.” 
“I will ask you a question, ascetic. 
If you don’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges!” 
“I don’t see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans who could do that to me. 
But anyway, ask what you wish.” 
“What’s a person’s best wealth? 
What brings happiness when practiced well? 
What’s the sweetest taste of all? 
The one they say has the best life: how do they live?” 
“Faith here is a person’s best wealth. 
The teaching brings happiness when practiced well. 
Truth is the sweetest taste of all. 
The one they say has the best life lives by wisdom.” 
“How do you cross the flood? 
How do you cross the deluge? 
How do you get over suffering? 
How do you get purified?” 
“By faith you cross the flood, 
and by diligence the deluge. 
By energy you get past suffering, 
and you’re purified by wisdom.” 
“How do you get wisdom? 
How do you earn wealth? 
How do you get a good reputation? 
How do you hold on to friends? 
How do the departed not grieve 
when passing from this world to the next?” 
“One who is diligent and discerning 
gains wisdom by wanting to learn, 
having faith in the perfected ones, 
and the teaching for becoming extinguished. 
Being responsible, acting appropriately, 
and working hard you earn wealth. 
Truthfulness wins you a good reputation. 
You hold on to friends by giving. 
That’s how the departed do not grieve 
when passing from this world to the next. 
A faithful householder 
who has these four qualities 
does not grieve after passing away: 
truth, principle, steadfastness, and generosity. 
Go ahead, ask others as well, 
there are many ascetics and brahmins. 
See whether anything better is found 
than truth, self-control, generosity, and patience.” 
“Why now would I question 
the many ascetics and brahmins? 
Today I understand 
what’s good for the next life. 
It was truly for my benefit 
that the Buddha came to stay at Āḷavī. 
Today I understand 
where a gift is very fruitful. 
I myself will journey 
village to village, town to town, 
paying homage to the Buddha, 
and the natural excellence of the teaching!” 






The Linked Discourses with Native Spirits are complete. 
^ck#s11(Sakka)^cksn#s11a(Chapter One )With Suvīra ^n247 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, the demons marched against the gods. 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Suvīra, 
‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! 
Go, and march against the demons!’ 
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But he fell into negligence. 
For a second time Sakka addressed Suvīra, 
‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! 
Go, and march against the demons!’ 
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But for a second time he fell into negligence. 
For a third time Sakka addressed Suvīra, 
‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! 
Go, and march against the demons!’ 
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But for a third time he fell into negligence. 
Then Sakka addressed the god Suvīra in verse: 
‘Suvīra, go to that place 
where you can achieve happiness 
without working for it or trying hard—
and take me with you!’ 
‘That a lazy man who does no work, 
and doesn’t do his duty, 
should fulfill all his desires: 
Sakka, grant me this boon!’ 
‘Suvīra, go to that place 
where a lazy man who does no work 
prospers in unending happiness—
and take me with you!’ 
‘O Sakka, first among gods, 
that we might find the happiness 
that’s sorrowless, unstressed: 
Sakka, grant me this boon!’ 
‘If there exists anywhere a place 
where one can live happily without working, 
that surely would be extinguishment’s path! 
Go there, Suvīra, 
and take me with you!’ 
So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of initiative and energy. 
But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and realize the unrealized!” 
Chapter One )With Susīma ^n248 At Sāvatthī. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, the demons marched against the gods. 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Susīma, 
‘Dear Susīma, the demons march against the gods! 
Go, and march against the demons!’ 
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Susīma. But he fell into negligence. 
For a second time … 

For a third time … 

Then Sakka addressed the god Susīma in verse: 
‘Susīma, go to that place 
where you can achieve happiness 
without working for it or trying hard—
and take me with you!’ 
‘That a lazy man who does no work, 
and doesn’t do his duty, 
should fulfill all his desires: 
Sakka, grant me this boon!’ 
‘Susīma, go to that place 
where a lazy man who does no work 
prospers in unending happiness—
and take me with you!’ 
‘O Sakka, first among gods, 
that we might find the happiness 
that’s sorrowless, unstressed: 
Sakka, grant me this boon!’ 
‘If there exists anywhere a place 
where one can live happily without working, 
that surely would be extinguishment’s path! 
Susīma, go to that place 
and take me with you!’ 
So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of initiative and energy. 
But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and realize the unrealized!” 
Chapter One )The Banner’s Crest ^n249 At Sāvatthī. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three: 
‘Good sirs, when the gods are fighting, if you get scared or terrified, just look up at my banner’s crest. 
Then your fear and terror will go away. 
If you can’t see my banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Pajāpati, king of gods. 
Then your fear and terror will go away. 
If you can’t see his banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Varuṇa, king of gods. 
Then your fear and terror will go away. 
If you can’t see his banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Īsāna, king of gods. 
Then your fear and terror will go away.’ 
However, when they look up at those banner’s crests their fear and terror might go away or it might not. 
Why is that? 
Because Sakka is not free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee. 
But, mendicants, I say this: 
If you’ve gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just recollect me: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
Then your fear and terror will go away. 
If you can’t recollect me, then recollect the teaching: 
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 
Then your fear and terror will go away. 
If you can’t recollect the teaching, then recollect the Saṅgha: 
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ 
Then your fear and terror will go away. 
Why is that? 
Because the Realized One is free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearless, brave, bold, and stands his ground.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“In the wilderness, at a tree’s root, 
or an empty hut, O mendicants, 
recollect the Buddha, 
and no fear will come to you. 
If you can’t recollect the Buddha—
the eldest in the world, the chief of men—
then recollect the teaching, 
emancipating, well taught. 
If you can’t recollect the teaching—
emancipating, well taught—
then recollect the Saṅgha, 
the supreme field of merit. 
Thus recollecting the Buddha, 
the teaching, and the Saṅgha, mendicants, 
fear and terror 
and goosebumps will be no more.” 
Chapter One )With Vepacitti ^n250 At Sāvatthī. 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons, 
‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the citadel of the demons.’ 
Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, 
‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Hall of Justice of the gods.’ 
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. 
So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Hall of Justice of the gods. 
And as Sakka was entering and leaving the hall, Vepacitti abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words. 
So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse, 
‘O Maghavā, O Sakka, 
is it from fear or from weakness 
that you put up with such harsh words 
in the presence of Vepacitti?’ 
‘It’s not out of fear or weakness 
that I’m patient with Vepacitti. 
For how can a sensible person like me 
get in a fight with a fool?’ 
‘Fools would vent even more 
if there’s no-one to put a stop to them. 
So a wise one should stop 
a fool with forceful punishment.’ 
‘I think that this is the only way 
to put a stop to a fool, 
when you know that the other is upset, 
be mindful and stay calm.’ 
‘I see this fault, Vāsava, 
in just being patient. 
When a fool thinks, 
“He puts up with me out of fear,” 
the idiot will go after you even harder, 
like a cow chasing someone who runs away.’ 
‘Let him think this if he wishes, or not—
“He puts up with me out of fear.” 
Of goals culminating in one’s own good, 
none better than patience is found. 
When a strong person 
puts up with a weakling, 
they call that the ultimate patience, 
for a weakling must always be patient. 
The strength of folly 
is really just weakness, they say. 
But no-one can challenge a person 
who’s strong, guarded by the teaching. 
When you get angry at an angry person 
you just make things worse for yourself. 
When you don’t get angry at an angry person 
you win a battle hard to win. 
When you know that the other is angry, 
you act for the good of both 
yourself and the other 
if you’re mindful and stay calm. 
People unfamiliar with the teaching 
consider one who heals both 
oneself and the other 
to be a fool.’ 
So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of patience and gentleness. 
But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to be patient and gentle!” 
Chapter One )Victory by Good Speech ^n251 At Sāvatthī. 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, said to Sakka, lord of gods, 
‘Lord of gods, let there be victory by fine words!’ 
‘Vepacitti, let there be victory by fine words!’ 
Then the gods and the demons appointed a panel of judges, saying, 
‘These will understand our good and bad statements.’ 
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, said to Sakka, lord of gods, 
‘Lord of gods, recite a verse!’ 
When he said this, Sakka said to him, 
‘Vepacitti, you are the elder god here. 
Recite a verse.’ 
So Vepacitti recited this verse: 
‘Fools would vent even more 
if there’s no-one to put a stop to them. 
So an intelligent person should stop 
a fool with forceful punishment.’ 
The demons applauded Vepacitti’s verse, while the gods kept silent. 
Then Vepacitti said to Sakka, 
‘Lord of gods, recite a verse!’ 
So Sakka recited this verse: 
‘I think that this is the only way 
to put a stop to a fool, 
when you know that the other is upset, 
be mindful and stay calm.’ 
The gods applauded Sakka’s verse, while the demons kept silent. 
Then Sakka said to Vepacitti, 
‘Vepacitti, recite a verse!’ 
So Vepacitti recited this verse: 
‘I see this fault, Vāsava, 
in just being patient. 
When a fool thinks, 
“He puts up with me out of fear,” 
the idiot will go after you even harder, 
like a cow chasing someone who runs away.’ 
The demons applauded Vepacitti’s verse, while the gods kept silent. 
Then Vepacitti said to Sakka, 
‘Lord of gods, recite a verse!’ 
So Sakka recited this verse: 
‘Let him think this if he wishes, or not—
“He puts up with me out of fear.” 
Of goals culminating in one’s own good, 
none better than patience is found. 
When a strong person 
puts up with a weakling, 
they call that the ultimate patience, 
for a weakling must always be patient. 
The strength of folly 
is really just weakness, they say. 
But no-one can challenge a person 
who’s strong, guarded by the teaching. 
When you get angry at an angry person 
you just make things worse for yourself. 
When you don’t get angry at an angry person 
you win a battle hard to win. 
When you know that the other is angry, 
you act for the good of both 
yourself and the other 
if you’re mindful and stay calm. 
People unfamiliar with the teaching 
consider one who heals both 
oneself and the other 
to be a fool.’ 
The gods applauded Sakka’s verses, while the demons kept silent. 
Then the panel of judges consisting of both gods and demons said this, 
‘The verses spoken by Vepacitti 
evoke punishment and violence. That’s how you get arguments, quarrels, and disputes. 
The verses spoken by Sakka 
don’t evoke punishment and violence. That’s how you stay free of arguments, quarrels, and disputes. 
Sakka, lord of gods, wins victory by fine words!’ 
And that’s how Sakka came to win victory by fine words.” 
Chapter One )Bird Nests ^n252 At Sāvatthī. 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
In that battle the demons won and the gods lost. 
Defeated, the gods fled north with the demons in pursuit. 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali in verse: 
‘Mātali, don’t ram the bird nests 
in the red silk-cotton woods with your chariot pole. 
I’d rather give up our lives to the demons 
than deprive these birds of their nests.’ 
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Mātali. And he turned the chariot back around, with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. 
Then the demons thought, 
‘Now Sakka’s chariot has turned back. 
The demons will have to fight the gods a second time!’ Terrified, they retreated right away to the citadel of the demons. 
And that’s how Sakka came to win victory by principle.” 
Chapter One )Not Betray ^n253 At Sāvatthī. 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, as Sakka, lord of gods, was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
‘I should never betray even a sworn enemy.’ 
And then Vepacitti, lord of demons, knowing what Sakka was thinking, approached him. 
Sakka saw Vepacitti coming off in the distance, 
and said to him, 
‘Stop, Vepacitti, you’re caught!’ 
‘Dear sir, don’t give up the idea you just had!’ 
‘Swear, Vepacitti, that you won’t betray me.’ 
‘Whatever bad things happen to a liar, 
or to someone who slanders the noble ones, 
or to someone who betrays a friend, 
or to someone who’s ungrateful, 
the same bad things impact 
anyone who betrays you, Sujā’s husband.’” 
Chapter One )Verocana, Lord of Demons ^n254 Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. 
Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Verocana, lord of demons, approached the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. 
Then Verocana recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“A man should make an effort 
until his goal is accomplished. 
When goals are accomplished they shine: 
this is the word of Verocana!” 
“A man should make an effort 
until his goal is accomplished. 
Of goals that shine when accomplished, 
none better than patience is found.” 
“All beings are goal-orientated, 
as befits them in each case. 
But connection is the ultimate 
of pleasures for all living creatures. 
When goals are accomplished they shine: 
this is the word of Verocana!” 
“All beings are goal-orientated, 
as befits them in each case. 
But connection is the ultimate 
of pleasures for all living creatures. 
Of goals that shine when accomplished, 
none better than patience is found.” 
Chapter One )Hermits in the Wilderness ^n255 At Sāvatthī. 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, several hermits who were ethical, of good character, settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region. 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Vepacitti, lord of demons, went to those hermits. 
Vepacitti put on his boots, strapped on his sword, and, carrying a sunshade, entered the hermitage through the main gate. He walked right past those hermits, keeping them at a distance. 
Sakka took off his boots, gave his sword to others, and, putting down his sunshade, entered the hermitage through a gate he happened upon. He stood downwind of those hermits, revering them with joined palms. 
Then those hermits addressed Sakka in verse: 
‘When hermits have been long ordained, 
the odor of their bodies goes with the wind. 
You’d better leave, O thousand-eyed! 
The odor of the hermits is unclean, king of gods.’ 
‘When hermits have been long ordained, 
let the odor of their bodies go with the wind. 
We yearn for this odor, sirs, 
like a colorful crown of flowers. 
The gods don’t see it as repulsive.’” 
Chapter One )Hermits by the Ocean ^n256 At Sāvatthī. 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, several hermits who were ethical, of good character, settled in leaf huts on the ocean shore. 
Now at that time a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
Then the hermits thought, 
‘The gods are principled, the demons are unprincipled. 
We may be at risk from the demons. 
Why don’t we approach Sambara, lord of demons, and beg him for a pledge of safety.’ 
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, those hermits vanished from those leaf huts on the ocean shore and reappeared in Sambara’s presence. 
Then those hermits addressed Sambara in verse: 
‘The hermits have come to Sambara 
to beg for a pledge of safety. 
For you can give them what you wish, 
whether danger or safety.’ 
‘There is no safety for hermits, 
the hated associates of Sakka! 
Though you beg me for your safety, 
I’ll only give you fear!’ 
‘Though we beg you for our safety, 
you give us only fear. 
This is what we get from you: 
may endless peril come to you! 
Whatever kind of seed you sow, 
that is the fruit you reap. 
A doer of good gets good, 
a doer of bad gets bad. 
You have sown your own seed, friend, 
now you’ll experience the fruit.’ 
Then those hermits, having cursed Sambara, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Sambara’s presence and reappeared in those leaf huts on the ocean shore. 
But after being cursed by the hermits, Sambara woke in alarm three times that night.” 









^cksn#s11b(Chapter Two )Vows ^n257 At Sāvatthī. 
“Mendicants, in a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka. 
What seven? 
As long as I live, may I support my parents. 
As long as I live, may I honor the elders in the family. 
As long as I live, may I speak gently. 
As long as I live, may I not speak divisively. 
As long as I live, may I live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. 
As long as I live, may I speak the truth. 
As long as I live, may I be free of anger, or should anger arise, may I quickly get rid of it. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka. 
A person who respects their parents, 
and honors the elders in the family, 
whose speech is gentle and courteous, 
and has given up divisiveness; 
who’s committed to getting rid of stinginess, 
is truthful, and has mastered anger: 
the gods of the Thirty-Three 
call them truly a good person.” 
Chapter Two )Sakka’s Names ^n258 Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. 
There the Buddha said to the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, in a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was a brahmanical student named Magha. That’s why he’s called Maghavā. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts in stronghold after stronghold. That’s why he’s called Purindada, the Stronghold-Giver. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts carefully. That’s why he’s called Sakka, the Careful. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave the gift of a guest house. That’s why he’s called Vāsava, the Houser. 
Sakka thinks of a thousand things in a moment. That’s why he’s called Sahassakkha, the Thousand-Eye. 
Sakka’s wife is the demon maiden named Sujā. That’s why he’s called Sujampati, Sujā’s Husband. 
Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the Thirty-Three. That’s why he’s called lord of gods. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka. 
What seven? 
As long as I live, may I support my parents. 
As long as I live, may I honor the elders in the family. 
As long as I live, may I speak gently.

As long as I live, may I speak the truth. 
As long as I live, may I be free of anger, or should anger arise, may I quickly get rid of it.

the gods of the Thirty-Three 
call them truly a good person.” 
Chapter Two )With Mahāli ^n259 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then Mahāli the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, have you seen Sakka, lord of gods?” 
“I have, Mahāli.” 
“But surely, sir, you must have seen someone who looked like Sakka. 
For Sakka is hard to see.” 
“Mahāli, I understand Sakka. And I understand the things that he undertook and committed to, which enabled him to achieve the status of Sakka. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was a brahmanical student named Magha. That’s why he’s called Maghavā. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts carefully. That’s why he’s called Sakka, the careful. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts in stronghold after stronghold. That’s why he’s called Purindada, the stronghold-giver. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave the gift of a guest house. That’s why he’s called Vāsava, the houser. 
Sakka thinks of a thousand things in a moment. That’s why he’s called Sahassakkha, Thousand-Eye. 
Sakka’s wife is the demon maiden named Sujā. That’s why he’s called Sujampati, Sujā’s husband. 
Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the Thirty-Three. That’s why he’s called Devānaminda, lord of gods. 
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka. 
What seven? 
As long as I live, may I support my parents. 
As long as I live, may I honor the elders in the family. 
As long as I live, may I speak gently. 
As long as I live, may I not speak divisively. 
As long as I live, may I live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.

who’s committed to getting rid of stinginess,

the gods of the Thirty-Three 
call them truly a good person.” 
Chapter Two )Poor ^n260 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a poor person, destitute and pitiful. 
They took up faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One. 
After undertaking these things, when their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. 
There they outshone the other gods in beauty and glory. 
But the gods of the Thirty-Three complained, grumbled, and objected, 
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
For when this god was a human being in their past life they were poor, destitute, and pitiful. 
And when their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. 
Here they outshine the other gods in beauty and glory.’ 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, 
‘Good sirs, don’t complain about this god. 
When this god was a human being in their past life they took up faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One. 
After undertaking these things, when their body broke up, after death, they’ve been reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. 
Here they outshine the other gods in beauty and glory.’ 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse: 
‘Whoever has faith in the Realized One, 
unwavering and well grounded; 
whose ethical conduct is good, 
praised and loved by the noble ones; 
who has confidence in the Saṅgha, 
and correct view: 
they’re said to be prosperous, 
their life is not in vain. 
So let the wise devote themselves 
to faith, ethical behaviour, 
confidence, and insight into the teaching, 
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.’” 
Chapter Two )Delightful ^n261 Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. 
And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, what is a delightful place?” 
“Shrines in parks and forests, 
well-made lotus ponds, 
are not worth a sixteenth part 
of a delightful human being. 
Whether in village or wilderness, 
in a valley or the uplands, 
wherever the perfected ones live 
is a delightful place.” 
Chapter Two )Sponsoring Sacrifice ^n262 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and addressed him in verse: 
“For humans, those merit-seeking creatures, 
who sponsor sacrifices, 
making worldly merit, 
where is a gift very fruitful?” 
“Four practicing the path, 
and four established in the fruit. 
This is the upright Saṅgha, 
with wisdom, ethics, and immersion. 
For humans, those merit-seeking creatures, 
who sponsor sacrifices, 
making worldly merit, 
what is given to the Saṅgha is very fruitful.” 
Chapter Two )Homage to the Buddha ^n263 Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. 
Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Brahmā Sahampati approached the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. 
Then Sakka recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
“Rise, hero! Victor in battle, with burden put down, 
wander the world without obligation. 
Your mind is fully liberated, 
like the moon on the fifteenth night.” 
“Lord of gods, that’s not how to pay homage to the Realized Ones. 
This is how it should be done: 
‘Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, 
wander the world without obligation. 
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! 
There will be those who understand!’” 
Chapter Two )Who Sakka Worships ^n264 At Sāvatthī. 

“Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali, 
‘My dear Mātali, harness the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. We will go to a park and see the scenery.’ 
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Mātali. He harnessed the chariot and informed Sakka, 
‘Good sir, the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds has been harnessed. 
Please go at your convenience.’ 
Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined palms, and revered the different quarters. 
So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse: 
‘Those proficient in the three Vedas worship you, 
as do all the aristocrats on earth, 
the Four Great Kings, 
and the glorious Thirty. 
So what’s the name of the spirit 
that you worship, Sakka?’ 
‘Those proficient in the three Vedas worship me, 
as do all the aristocrats on earth, 
the Four Great Kings, 
and the glorious Thirty. 
But I revere those accomplished in ethics, 
who have long trained in immersion, 
who have rightly gone forth 
committed to the spiritual life. 
I also worship those householders, 
the ethical lay followers 
who make merit, Mātali, 
supporting a partner in a principled manner.’ 
‘Those who you worship 
seem to be the best in the world, Sakka. 
I too will worship 
those who you worship, Sakka.’ 
After saying this, Maghavā the chief, 
king of gods, Sujā’s husband, 
having worshipped the quarters 
climbed into his chariot.”

Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined palms, and revered the Buddha. 
So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse: 
‘Gods and men 
worship you, Vāsava. 
So what’s the name of the spirit 
that you worship, Sakka?’ 
‘It’s the fully awakened Buddha, 
the Teacher of peerless name 
in this world with its gods—
that’s who I worship, Mātali. 
Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance 
have faded away; 
the perfected ones with defilements ended—
they're who I worship, Mātali. 
The trainees who enjoy reducing suffering, 
diligently pursuing the training 
for getting rid of greed and hate, 
and going past ignorance—
they’re who I worship, Mātali.’ 
‘Those who you worship 
seem to be the best in the world, Sakka. 
I too will worship 
those who you worship, Sakka.’ 
After saying this, Maghavā the chief, 
king of gods, Sujā’s husband, 
having worshipped the Buddha, 
climbed into his chariot.” 
Chapter Two )Who Sakka Worships ^n266 Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. 

“Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali, 
‘My dear Mātali, harness the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. We will go to a park and see the scenery.’

Please go at your convenience.’ 
Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined palms, and revered the mendicant Saṅgha. 
So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse: 
‘It’s these who should worship you, 
namely the humans stuck in their putrid bodies, 
sunk in a carcass, 
stricken by hunger and thirst. 
Why then do you envy those 
who are homeless, Vāsava? 
Relate the hermits’ way of life, 
let us hear what you say.’ 
‘This is why I envy the 
homeless, Mātali. 
When they leave a village, 
they proceed without concern. 
They hoard no goods in storerooms, 
nor in pots or baskets. 
They seek food prepared by others, 
and, true to their vows, live on that. 
The wise whose words are full of wisdom, 
live peacefully and quietly. 
Gods fight with demons, 
and mortals fight each other, Mātali. 
Not fighting among those who fight, 
extinguished among those who are armed, 
not grasping among those who grasp: 
they’re who I worship, Mātali.’ 
‘Those who you worship 
seem to be the best in the world, Sakka. 
I too will worship 
those who you worship, Vāsava.’ 
After saying this, Maghavā the chief, 
king of gods, Sujā’s husband, 
having worshipped the mendicant Saṅgha, 
climbed into his chariot.” 






^cksn#s11c(Chapter Three )Incinerated ^n267 Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. 
And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, 
and addressed him in verse: 
“When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease? 
When what is incinerated is there no sorrow? 
What is the one thing 
whose killing you approve?” 
“When anger’s incinerated you sleep at ease. 
When anger’s incinerated there is no sorrow. 
O Vāsava, anger has a poisonous root 
and a honey tip. 
The noble ones praise its killing, 
for when it’s incinerated there is no sorrow.” 
Chapter Three )Ugly ^n268 Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. 

“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a native spirit who was ugly and deformed. He sat on the throne of Sakka, lord of gods. 
But the gods of the Thirty-Three complained, grumbled, and objected, 
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
This ugly and deformed spirit is sitting on the throne of Sakka, the lord of gods.’ 
But the more the gods complained, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely that spirit became. 
So the gods went up to Sakka and told him what had happened, adding, 





‘Surely, good sir, that must be the anger-eating spirit!’ 
Then Sakka went up to that spirit, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the anger-eating spirit, and pronounced his name three times: 
‘Good sir, I am Sakka, lord of gods! Good sir, I am Sakka, the lord of gods!’ 
But the more Sakka pronounced his name, the uglier and more deformed the spirit became, 
until eventually it vanished right there. 
Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse: 
‘My mind isn’t easily upset; 
I’m not easily drawn into the maelstrom. 
I don’t get angry for long, 
anger doesn’t last in me. 
When I do get angry I don’t speak harshly, 
nor do I advertise my own virtues. 
I carefully restrain myself 
out of regard for my own welfare.’” 
Chapter Three )The Sambari Sorcery ^n269 At Sāvatthī. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, Vepacitti, lord of demons, was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
So Sakka went to see him to ask after his illness. 
Vepacitti saw Sakka coming off in the distance, 
and said to him, 
‘Heal me, lord of gods!’ 
‘Teach me, Vepacitti, the Sambari sorcery.’ 
‘I can’t do that, good sir, until I have consulted with the demons.’ 
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, asked the demons, 
‘Good sirs, may I teach the Sambari sorcery to Sakka, lord of gods?’ 
‘Do not, good sir, teach the Sambari sorcery to Sakka!’ 
So Vepacitti addressed Sakka in verse: 
‘O Maghavā, O Sakka, 
king of gods, Sujā’s husband, 
a sorceror falls into the terrible hell—
like Sambara, for a hundred years.’” 
Chapter Three )Transgression ^n270 At Sāvatthī. 
Now at that time two mendicants were overly attached, 
and one of them transgressed against the other. 
The transgressor confessed to the other mendicant, 
but they didn’t accept it. 
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 


“Mendicants, there are two fools. 
One who doesn’t recognize when they’ve made a mistake. And one who doesn’t properly accept the confession of someone who’s made a mistake. 
These are the two fools. 
There are two who are astute. 
One who recognizes when they’ve made a mistake. And one who properly accepts the confession of someone who’s made a mistake. 
These are the two who are astute. 
Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse: 
‘Control your anger; 
don’t let friendships decay. 
Don’t blame the blameless, 
and don’t say divisive things. 
For anger crushes bad people 
like a mountain.’” 
Chapter Three )Don’t Be Angry ^n271 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse: 
‘Don’t let anger be your master, 
don’t get angry at angry people. 
Kindness and harmlessness 
are always present in the noble ones. 
For anger crushes bad people 
like a mountain.’”
