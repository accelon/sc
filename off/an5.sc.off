^ck#a5(Book of Five)^ckan#a5a(1. Powers of a Trainee )In Brief ^bk#an5^n1 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, there are these five powers of a trainee. 
What five? 
The powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom. 
These are the five powers of a trainee. 
So you should train like this: 
‘We will have the trainee’s powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.’ 
That’s how you should train.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. 

1. Powers of a Trainee )In Detail ^n2 “Mendicants, there are these five powers of a trainee. 
What five? 
The powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom. 
And what is the power of faith? 
It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
This is called the power of faith. 
And what is the power of conscience? 
It’s when a noble disciple has a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities. 
This is called the power of conscience. 
And what is the power of prudence? 
It’s when a noble disciple is prudent. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities. 
This is called the power of prudence. 
And what is the power of energy? 
It’s when a noble disciple lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. 
This is called the power of energy. 
And what is the power of wisdom? 
It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. 
This is called the power of wisdom. 
These are the five powers of a trainee. 
So you should train like this: 
‘We will have the trainee’s powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.’ 
That’s how you should train.” 

1. Powers of a Trainee )Suffering ^n3 “Mendicants, when a mendicant has five qualities they live unhappily in the present life—with distress, anguish, and fever—and when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect a bad rebirth. 
What five? 
It’s when a mendicant is faithless, shameless, imprudent, lazy, and witless.

When a mendicant has these five qualities they live happily in the present life—without distress, anguish, or fever—and when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect a good rebirth.” 

1. Powers of a Trainee )Cast Down ^n4 “Mendicants, a mendicant with five qualities is cast down to hell. 
What five? 
It’s when a mendicant is faithless, shameless, imprudent, lazy, and witless. 
A mendicant with these five qualities is cast down to hell.

What five? 
It’s when a mendicant is faithful, conscientious, prudent, energetic, and wise.

1. Powers of a Trainee )Disrobing ^n5 “Mendicants, any monk or nun who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life deserves rebuke and criticism on five legitimate grounds in the present life. 
What five? 
‘You had no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, or wisdom regarding skillful qualities.’ 
Any monk or nun who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life deserves rebuke and criticism on these five legitimate grounds in the present life. 
Any monk or nun who lives the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, with tearful face, deserves praise on five legitimate grounds in the present life. 
What five? 
‘You had faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities.’ 
Any monk or nun who lives the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, with tearful face, deserves praise on these five legitimate grounds in the present life.” 

1. Powers of a Trainee )Becoming ^n6 “Mendicants, you don’t become unskillful as long as faith is established in skillful qualities. 
But when faith vanishes and faithlessness takes over, 
you become unskillful. 
You don’t become unskillful as long as conscience … prudence … energy … wisdom is established in skillful qualities. 









But when wisdom vanishes and witlessness takes over, 
you become unskillful.” 

1. Powers of a Trainee )Sensual Pleasures ^n7 “Mendicants, sentient beings are mostly charmed by sensual pleasures. 
When a gentleman has abandoned the scythe and flail and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, they’re qualified to be called ‘a faithful renunciate from a good family’. 
Why is that? 
Because a youth can get sensual pleasures of this kind or that. 
Now, all sensual pleasures are just reckoned as ‘sensual pleasures’, regardless of whether they’re inferior, average, or superior. 
Suppose there was a little baby boy who, because of his nurse’s negligence, puts a stick or stone in his mouth. 
The nurse would very quickly notice 
and try to take it out. 
If that didn’t work, she’d cradle his head with her left hand, and take it out using a hooked finger of her right hand, even if it drew blood. 
Why is that? 
I admit she’d know, ‘This will distress the child, 
there’s no denying.’ 
Still, it should be done by a nurse who wants what’s best for him, out of kindness and compassion. 
And when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, his nurse would not worry about him, thinking: 
‘The boy can look after himself. He won’t be negligent.’ 
In the same way, I still need to look after a mendicant who hasn’t finished developing faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities. 
But when a mendicant has finished developing faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities, I need not be concerned, thinking: 
‘They can look after themselves. They won’t be negligent.’”

3. With Five Factors )Immersion ^n27 “Mendicants, develop limitless immersion, alert and mindful.

3. With Five Factors )With Five Factors ^n28 “Mendicants, I will teach you how to develop noble right immersion with five factors. 
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“And how do you develop noble right immersion with five factors? 
Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. 
It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. 
This is the first way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. 
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. 
But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
This is the second way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. 
Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. 
It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. 
From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. 
There’s no part of them that’s not spread through with cool water. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. 
This is the third way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. 
Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption. It is without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. 
It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth. 
In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. 
This is the fourth way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. 
Furthermore, the meditation that is a foundation for reviewing is properly grasped, attended, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant. 
It’s like when someone views someone else. Someone standing might view someone sitting, or someone sitting might view someone lying down. 
In the same way, the meditation that is a foundation for reviewing is properly grasped, attended, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant. 
This is the fifth way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. 
When the noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. 
Suppose a water jar was placed on a stand, full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. 
If a strong man was to tip it any which way, would water pour out?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. 
Suppose there was a square, walled lotus pond on level ground, full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. 
If a strong man was to open the wall on any side, would water pour out?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. 
Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready. 
Then a deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes. 
In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, 
a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. 
If you wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.’ 
You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
If you wish: ‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’ 
You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
If you wish: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. 
May I understand mind with greed as “mind with greed”, 
and mind without greed as “mind without greed”; 
mind with hate as “mind with hate”, 
and mind without hate as “mind without hate”; 
mind with delusion as “mind with delusion”, 
and mind without delusion as “mind without delusion”; 
constricted mind as “constricted mind”, 
and scattered mind as “scattered mind”; 
expansive mind as “expansive mind”, 
and unexpansive mind as “unexpansive mind”; 
mind that is not supreme as “mind that is not supreme”, 
and mind that is supreme as “mind that is supreme”; 
mind immersed in samādhi as “mind immersed in samādhi”, 
and mind not immersed in samādhi as “mind not immersed in samādhi”; 
freed mind as “freed mind”, 
and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’ 
You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
If you wish: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details.’ 
You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
If you wish: ‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn according to their deeds.’ 
You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
If you wish: ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ 
You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.” 

3. With Five Factors )Walking Meditation ^n29 “Mendicants, there are five benefits of walking meditation. 
What five? 
You get fit for traveling, fit for striving in meditation, and healthy. What’s eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted is properly digested. And immersion gained while walking lasts long. 
These are the five benefits of walking meditation.” 

3. With Five Factors )With Nāgita ^n30 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. 
He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. 
The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard: 
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
Then, when the night had passed, they took many fresh and cooked foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket. 
Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant. 
Then the Buddha said to Nāgita, 
“Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!” 
“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many fresh and cooked foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.” 
“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me. 
There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. 
Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.” 
“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent! 
Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. 
Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. 
It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill. 
In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. 
Why is that? 
Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.” 
“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me. 
There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. 
Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity. 
What you eat, drink, chew, and taste ends up as excrement and urine. 
This is its outcome. 
When loved ones decay and perish, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress arise. 
This is its outcome. 
When you pursue meditation on the feature of ugliness, revulsion at the feature of beauty becomes stabilized. 
This is its outcome. 
When you meditate observing impermanence in the six fields of contact, revulsion at contact becomes stabilized. 
This is its outcome. 
When you meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates, revulsion at grasping becomes stabilized. 
This is its outcome.” 







^ckan#a5d(4. With Sumanā )With Sumanā ^n31 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then Princess Sumanā, escorted by five hundred chariots and five hundred royal maidens, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, suppose there were two disciples equal in faith, ethics, and wisdom. 
One is a giver, one is not. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
When they have become gods, would there be any distinction or difference between them?” 
“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha. 
“As a god, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects: 
divine lifespan, beauty, happiness, fame, and sovereignty. 
As a god, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.” 
“But sir, if they pass away from there and come back to this state of existence as human beings, would there still be any distinction or difference between them?” 
“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha. 
“As a human being, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects: 
human lifespan, beauty, happiness, fame, and sovereignty. 
As a human being, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.” 
“But sir, if they both go forth from the lay life to homelessness, would there still be any distinction or difference between them?” 
“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha. 
“As a renunciate, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects. 
They’d usually use only what they’ve been invited to accept—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—rarely using them without invitation. 
When living with other spiritual practitioners, they usually treat them agreeably by way of body, speech, and mind, rarely disagreeably. 
As a renunciate, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.” 
“But sir, if they both attain perfection, as perfected ones would there still be any distinction or difference between them?” 
“In that case, I say there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.” 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
This is quite enough to justify giving gifts and making merit. 
For merit is helpful for those who have become gods, human beings, and renunciates.” 
“That’s so true, Sumanā. 
It’s quite enough to justify giving gifts and making merit. 
For merit is helpful for those who have become gods, human beings, and renunciates.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“The moon so immaculate, 
journeying across the dimension of space; 
outshines with its radiance 
all the world’s stars. 
So too, a faithful individual, 
perfect in ethics, 
outshines with their generosity 
all the world’s stingy people. 
The thundering rain cloud, 
its hundred peaks wreathed in lightning, 
pours down over the rich earth, 
soaking the uplands and valleys. 
Even so, an astute person accomplished in vision, 
a disciple of the fully awakened Buddha, 
surpasses a stingy person 
in five respects: 
long life and fame, 
beauty and happiness. 
Lavished with riches, 
they depart to rejoice in heaven.” 

4. With Sumanā )With Cundī ^n32 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
Then Princess Cundī, escorted by five hundred chariots and five hundred royal maidens, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, my brother, Prince Cunda, says this: 
‘Take a woman or man who goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. Only then do they get reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when their body breaks up, after death.’ 
And so I ask the Buddha: 
Sir, what kind of teacher should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death? 
Sir, what kind of teaching should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death? 
Sir, what kind of Saṅgha should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death? 
Sir, what kind of ethics should you fulfill so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death?” 
“Cundī, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said to be the best of all sentient beings—be they footless, with two feet, four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception. 
Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best. 
Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 
The noble eightfold path is said to be the best of all conditioned things. 
Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 
Fading away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or unconditioned. 
That is, the quelling of vanity, the removing of thirst, the uprooting of clinging, the breaking of the round, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. 
Those who have confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best. 
Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 
The Saṅgha of the Realized One’s disciples is said to be the best of all communities and groups. 
It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. 
Those who have confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in the best. 
Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 
The ethical conduct loved by the noble ones is said to be the best of all ethics. 
It is unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. 
Those who fulfill the ethics loved by the noble ones fulfill the best. 
Fulfilling the best, the result is the best. 
For those who, knowing the best teaching, 
base their confidence on the best—
confident in the best Awakened One, 
supremely worthy of a religious donation; 
confident in the best teaching, 
the bliss of fading and stilling; 
confident in the best Saṅgha, 
the supreme field of merit—
giving gifts to the best, 
the best of merit grows: 
the best lifespan, beauty, 
fame, reputation, happiness, and strength. 
An intelligent person gives to the best, 
settled on the best teaching. 
When they become a god or human, 
they rejoice at reaching the best.” 

4. With Sumanā )With Uggaha ^n33 At one time the Buddha was staying near Bhaddiya, in Jātiyā Wood. 
Then Uggaha, Meṇḍaka’s grandson, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, may the Buddha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.” 
The Buddha consented with silence. 
Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Uggaha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Uggaha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
Then Uggaha served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. 
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Uggaha sat down to one side, 
and said to him, 
“Sir, these girls of mine will be going to their husbands’ families. 
May the Buddha please advise 
and instruct them. It will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” 
Then the Buddha said to those girls: 
“So, girls, you should train like this: 
‘Our parents will give us to a husband wanting what’s best, out of kindness and compassion. We will get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
So, girls, you should train like this: 
‘Those our husband respects—mother and father, ascetics and brahmins—we will honor, respect, revere, and venerate, and serve with a seat and a drink when they come as guests.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
So, girls, you should train like this: 
‘We will be deft and tireless in doing domestic duties for our husband, such as knitting and sewing. We will have an understanding of how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
So, girls, you should train like this: 
‘We will know what work our husband’s domestic bondservants, workers, and staff have completed, and what they’ve left incomplete. We will know who is sick, and who is fit or unwell. We will distribute to each a fair portion of fresh and cooked foods.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
So, girls, you should train like this: 
‘We will ensure that any income our husbands earn is guarded and protected, whether money, grain, silver, or gold. We will not overspend, steal, waste, or lose it.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
When they have these five qualities, females—when their body breaks up, after death—are reborn in company with the Gods of the Lovable Host. 
She’d never look down on her husband, 
who’s always eager to work hard, 
always looking after her, 
and bringing whatever she wants. 
And a good woman never scolds her husband 
with jealous words. 
Being astute, she reveres 
those respected by her husband. 
She gets up early, works tirelessly, 
and manages the domestic help. 
She’s lovable to her husband, 
and preserves his wealth. 
A lady who fulfills these duties 
according to her husband’s desire, 
is reborn among the gods 
called ‘Lovable’.” 

4. With Sumanā )With General Sīha ^n34 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked him, 
“Sir, can you point out a fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life?” 
“I can, Sīha,” said the Buddha. 
“A giver, a donor is dear and beloved to many people. 
This is a fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life. 
Furthermore, good people associate with a giver. 
This is another fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life. 
Furthermore, a giver gains a good reputation. 
This is another fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life. 
Furthermore, a giver enters any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics. 
This is another fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life. 
Furthermore, when a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
This is a fruit of giving to do with lives to come.” 
When he said this, General Sīha said to the Buddha, 
“When it comes to those four fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life, I don’t have to rely on faith in the Buddha, for I know them too. 
I’m a giver, a donor, and am dear and beloved to many people. 
I’m a giver, and good people associate with me. 
I’m a giver, and I have this good reputation: ‘General Sīha gives, serves, and attends on the Saṅgha.’ 
I’m a giver, and I enter any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics. 
When it comes to these four fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life, I don’t have to rely on faith in the Buddha, for I know them too. 
But when the Buddha says: 
‘When a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ I don’t know this, so I have to rely on faith in the Buddha.” 
“That’s so true, Sīha! That’s so true! 
When a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
Giving, you’re loved and befriended by many people. 
You get a good reputation, and your fame grows. 
A generous man enters an assembly 
bold and assured. 
So an astute person, seeking happiness, <j>would give gifts, 
having driven out the stain of stinginess. 
They live long in the heaven of the Three and Thirty, 
enjoying the company of the gods. 
Having taken the opportunity to do good, <j>when they pass from here 
they wander radiant in the Garden of Delight. 
There they delight, rejoice, and enjoy themselves, 
provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. 
Having practiced the word of the unattached, <j>the poised, 
disciples of the Holy One rejoice in heaven.” 

4. With Sumanā )The Benefits of Giving ^n35 “Mendicants, there are five benefits of giving. 
What five? 
A giver, a donor is dear and beloved by many people. 
Good people associate with them. 
They get a good reputation. 
They don’t neglect a layperson’s duties. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
These are the five benefits of giving. 
Giving, one is loved, 
and follows the way of the good. 
The good, disciplined spiritual practitioners 
associate with you. 
They teach you the Dhamma 
that dispels all suffering. 
Having understood this teaching, 
the undefiled become fully extinguished.” 

4. With Sumanā )Timely Gifts ^n36 “Mendicants, there are these five timely gifts. 
What five? 
A gift to a visitor. 
A gift to someone setting out on a journey. 
A gift to someone who is sick. 
A gift at a time of famine. 
Presenting the freshly harvested grains and fruits first to those who are ethical. 
These are the five timely gifts. 
The wise give at the right time, 
being bountiful and rid of stinginess. 
A religious donation at the right time 
to the noble ones, upright and poised, 
given with a clear and confident mind, 
is indeed abundant. 
Those who rejoice at that, 
or do other services, 
don’t miss out on the offering; 
they too have a share in the merit. 
So you should give without holding back, 
where a gift is very fruitful. 
The good deeds of sentient beings 
support them in the next world.” 

4. With Sumanā )Food ^n37 “Mendicants, when a giver gives food, they give the recipients five things. 
What five? 
Long life, beauty, happiness, strength, and eloquence. 
Giving long life, they have long life as a god or human. 
Giving beauty, they have beauty as a god or human. 
Giving happiness, they have happiness as a god or human. 
Giving strength, they have strength as a god or human. 
Giving eloquence, they are eloquent as a god or human. 
When a giver gives food, they give the recipients five things. 
A wise one is a giver of life, strength, 
beauty, and eloquence. 
An intelligent giver of happiness 
gains happiness in return. 
Giving life, strength, beauty, 
happiness, and eloquence, 
they’re long-lived and famous 
wherever they’re reborn.” 

4. With Sumanā )Faith ^n38 “Mendicants, a faithful gentleman gets five benefits. 
What five? 
The good persons in the world show compassion first to the faithful, not so much to the unfaithful. 
They first approach the faithful, not so much the unfaithful. 
They first receive alms from the faithful, not so much the unfaithful. 
They first teach Dhamma to the faithful, not so much the unfaithful. 
When their body breaks up, after death, the faithful are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
A faithful gentleman gets these five benefits. 
Suppose there was a great banyan tree at a level crossroads. It would become a refuge for birds from all around. 
In the same way, a faithful gentleman becomes a refuge for many people—monks, nuns, laywomen, and laymen. 
With its branches, leaves, and fruit, 
a great tree with its strong trunk, 
firmly-rooted and fruit-bearing, 
supports many birds. 
It’s a lovely place, 
frequented by the sky-soarers. 
Those that need shade go in the shade, 
those that need fruit enjoy the fruit. 
So too, a faithful individual 
is perfect in ethics, 
humble and amenable, 
sweet, courteous, and tender. 
Those free of greed, freed of hate, 
free of delusion, undefiled, 
fields of merit for the world, 
associate with such a person. 
They teach them the Dhamma, 
that dispels all suffering. 
Having understood this teaching, 
the undefiled become fully extinguished.” 

4. With Sumanā )A Child ^n39 “Mendicants, parents see five reasons to wish for the birth of a child in the family. 
What five? 
Since we looked after them, they’ll look after us. 
They’ll do their duty for us. 
The family traditions will last. 
They’ll take care of the inheritance. 
Or else when we have passed away they’ll give an offering on our behalf. 
Parents see these five reasons to wish for the birth of a child in the family. 
Seeing five reasons, 
astute people wish for a child. 
Since we looked after them, they’ll look after us. 
They’ll do their duty for us. 
The family traditions will last. 
They’ll take care of the inheritance. 
Or else when we have passed away 
they’ll give an offering on our behalf. 
Seeing these five reasons 
astute people wish for a child. 
And so good people, 
grateful and thankful, 
look after their parents, 
remembering past deeds. 
They do for their parents, 
as their parents did for them in the past. 
Following their advice, <j>looking after those who raised them, 
the family traditions are not lost. 
Faithful, accomplished in ethics, 
such a child is praiseworthy.” 

4. With Sumanā )Great Sal Trees ^n40 “Mendicants, great sal trees grow in five ways supported by the Himalayas, the king of mountains. 
What five? 
The branches, leaves, and foliage; 
the bark; 
the shoots; 
the softwood; 
and the hardwood. 
Great sal trees grow in these five ways supported by the Himalayas, the king of mountains. 
In the same way, a family grows in five ways supported by a family head with faith. 
What five? 
Faith, 
ethics, 
learning, 
generosity, 
and wisdom. 
A family grows in these five ways supported by a family head with faith. 
Supported by the mountain crags 
in the wilds, the formidable forest, 
the tree grows 
to become lord of the forest. 
So too, when the family head 
is ethical and faithful, 
supported by them, they grow: 
children, partners, and kin, 
colleagues, relatives, 
and those dependent for their livelihood. 
Seeing the ethical conduct of the virtuous, 
the generosity and good deeds, 
those who see clearly 
do likewise. 
Having practiced the teaching here, 
the path that goes to a good place, 
they delight in the heavenly realm, 
enjoying all the pleasures they desire.” 







^ckan#a5e(5. With King Muṇḍa )Getting Rich ^n41 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Householder, there are these five reasons to get rich. 
What five? 
Firstly, with his legitimate wealth—earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow—a noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased, keeping himself properly happy. 
He makes his mother and father happy … 
He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff happy … 
This is the first reason to get rich. 
Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes his friends and colleagues happy … 
This is the second reason to get rich. 
Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he protects himself against losses from such things as fire, water, kings, bandits, or unloved heirs. 

He keeps himself safe. 
This is the third reason to get rich. 
Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings: 
to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities. 
This is the fourth reason to get rich. 
Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins—those who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves—that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. 
This is the fifth reason to get rich. 
These are the five reasons to get rich. 
Now if the riches a noble disciple gets for these five reasons run out, he thinks: 
‘So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are running out.’ 
And so he has no regrets. 
But if the riches a noble disciple gets for these five reasons increase, he thinks: 
‘So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are increasing.’ 
And so he has no regrets in both cases. 
‘I’ve enjoyed my wealth, <j>supporting those who depend on me; 
I’ve overcome losses; 
I’ve given uplifting religious donations; 
and made the five spirit-offerings. 
I have looked after the ethical and 
disciplined spiritual practitioners. 
I’ve achieved the purpose 
for which an astute lay person 
wishes to gain wealth. 
I don’t regret what I’ve done.’ 
A mortal person who recollects this 
stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones. 
They’re praised in this life by the astute, 
and they depart to rejoice in heaven.” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )A Good Person ^n42 “Mendicants, a good person is born in a family for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the people. 
For the benefit, welfare, and happiness of mother and father; 
children and partners; 
bondservants, workers, and staff; 
friends and colleagues; 
and ascetics and brahmins. 
It’s like a great rain cloud, which nourishes all the crops for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the people. 
In the same way, a good person is born in a family for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the people. … 





The gods protect one who is guarded by principle, 
who uses their wealth for the welfare of the many. 
One who is learned, <j>with precepts and observances intact, 
and steady in principle, doesn’t lose their reputation. 
Firm in principle, accomplished in ethical conduct, 
truthful, conscientious; 
like a pendant of river gold, 
who is worthy to criticize them? 
Even the gods praise them, 
and by Brahmā, too, they’re praised.” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )Likable ^n43 Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Householder, these five things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable are hard to get in the world. 
What five? 
Long life, 
beauty, 
happiness, 
fame, 
and heaven. 
These are the five things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world. 
And I say that these five things are not got by praying or wishing for them. 
If they were, who would lack them? 
A noble disciple who wants to live long ought not pray for it, or hope for it, or pine for it. 
Instead, they should practice the way that leads to long life. 
For by practicing that way they gain long life 
as a god or a human being. 
A noble disciple who wants to be beautiful ought not pray for it, or hope for it, or pine for it. 
Instead, they should practice the way that leads to beauty. 
For by practicing that way they gain beauty 
as a god or a human being. 
A noble disciple who wants to be happy ought not pray for it, or hope for it, or pine for it. 
Instead, they should practice the way that leads to happiness. 
For by practicing that way they gain happiness 
as a god or a human being. 
A noble disciple who wants to be famous ought not pray for it, or hope for it, or pine for it. 
Instead, they should practice the way that leads to fame. 
For by practicing that way they gain fame 
as a god or a human being. 
A noble disciple who wants to go to heaven ought not pray for it, or hope for it, or pine for it. 
Instead, they should practice the way that leads to heaven. 
For by practicing that way they gain heaven, 
they are one who gains the heavens. 
For one who desires a continuous flow 
of exceptional delights—
long life, beauty, fame and reputation, 
heaven, and birth in an eminent family—
the astute praise diligence 
in making merit. 
Being diligent, an astute person 
secures both benefits: 
the benefit in this life, 
and in lives to come. 
A wise one, comprehending the meaning, 
is called ‘astute’.” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )Agreeable ^n44 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of Vesālī, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
Then Ugga went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 
‘The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable.’ 
My sal flower porridge is agreeable: 
may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion.” 
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion. 
“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 
‘The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable.’ 
My pork with jujube is agreeable: 
may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion.” 
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion. 


“… My fried vegetable stalks are agreeable: 
may the Buddha please accept them from me out of compassion.” 
So the Buddha accepted them out of compassion. 


“… My boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces is agreeable: 
may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion.” 
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion. 


“… My cloths imported from Kāsi are agreeable: 
may the Buddha please accept them from me out of compassion.” 
So the Buddha accepted them out of compassion. 


“… My couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends is agreeable. 
But, sir, I know that 
this is not proper for the Buddha. 
However, this plank of sandalwood is worth over a thousand dollars. 
May the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion.” 
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion. 
And then the Buddha rejoiced with Ugga with these verses of appreciation: 
“The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable, 
enthusiastically giving clothing, bedding, 
food and drink, and various requisites 
to those of upright conduct. 
Knowing the perfected ones to be like a field 
for what’s given, offered and not held back, 
a good person gives what’s hard to give: 
the giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable.” 
And then the Buddha, having rejoiced with Ugga with these verses of appreciation, got up from his seat and left. 
Then after some time Ugga passed away, 
and was reborn in a host of mind-made gods. 
At that time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then, late at night, the glorious god Ugga, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
“Ugga, I trust it is all you wished?” 
“Sir, it is indeed just as I wished.” 
Then the Buddha addressed Ugga in verse: 
“The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable, 
the giver of the foremost gets the foremost, 
the giver of the excellent gets the excellent, 
the giver of the best gets the best. 
A person who gives the foremost, 
the excellent, the best: 
they’re long-lived and famous 
wherever they’re reborn.” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )Overflowing Merit ^n45 “Mendicants, there are these five kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. 
What five? 
When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart while using a robe … 
almsfood … lodging … bed and chair … 
medicines and supplies for the sick, the overflowing of merit for the donor is limitless … 
These are the five kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness, and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness, and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. 
When a noble disciple has these five kinds of overflowing merit and goodness, it’s not easy to grasp how much merit they have by saying that 
this is the extent of their overflowing merit … that leads to happiness. 
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit. 
It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say: 
‘This is how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are.’ 
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water. 
In the same way, when a noble disciple has these five kinds of overflowing merit and goodness, it’s not easy to grasp how much merit they have: 
‘This is how much this overflowing merit … leads to happiness.’ 
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit. 
Hosts of people use the rivers, 
and though the rivers are many, 
all reach the great deep, the boundless ocean, 
the cruel sea that’s home to precious gems. 
So too, when a person gives food, drink, and clothes; 
and they’re a giver of beds, seats, and mats—
the streams of merit reach that astute person, 
as the rivers bring their waters to the sea.” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )Success ^n46 “Mendicants, there are five accomplishments. 
What five? 
Accomplishment in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. 
These are the five accomplishments.” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )Wealth ^n47 “Mendicants, there are these five kinds of wealth. 
What five? 
The wealth of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. 
And what is the wealth of faith? 
It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
This is called the wealth of faith. 
And what is the wealth of ethics? 
It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
This is called the wealth of ethics. 
And what is the wealth of learning? 
It’s when a noble disciple is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. 
This is called the wealth of learning. 
And what is the wealth of generosity? 
It’s when a noble disciple lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. 
This is called the wealth of generosity. 
And what is the wealth of wisdom? 
It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. 
This is called the wealth of wisdom. 
These are the five kinds of wealth. 
Whoever has faith in the Realized One, 
unwavering and well grounded; 
whose ethical conduct is good, 
praised and loved by the noble ones; 
who has confidence in the Saṅgha, 
and correct view: 
they’re said to be prosperous, 
their life is not in vain. 
So let the wise devote themselves 
to faith, ethical behavior, 
confidence, and insight into the teaching, 
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )Things That Cannot Be Had ^n48 “Mendicants, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
What five? 
That someone liable to old age should not grow old. 
That someone liable to sickness should not get sick. … That someone liable to death should not die. … That someone liable to ending should not end. … That someone liable to perishing should not perish. … 
An unlearned ordinary person has someone liable to old age who grows old. 
But they don’t reflect on old age: 
‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to old age who grows old. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to old age who grows old. 
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to old age grows old, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’ 
And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. 
This is called 
an unlearned ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves. 
Furthermore, an unlearned ordinary person has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing. 
But they don’t reflect on perishing: 
‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to perishing who perishes. 
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’ 
And so, when someone liable to perishing perishes, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. 
This is called 
an unlearned ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves. 
A learned noble disciple has someone liable to old age who grows old. 
So they reflect on old age: 
‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to old age who grows old. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to old age who grows old. 
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to old age grows old, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’ 
And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. 
This is called 
a learned noble disciple who has drawn out sorrow’s poisoned arrow, struck by which unlearned ordinary people only mortify themselves. 
Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves. 
Furthermore, a learned noble disciple has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing. 
So they reflect on perishing: 
‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to perishing who perishes. 
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate.

a learned noble disciple who has drawn out sorrow’s poisoned arrow, struck by which unlearned ordinary people only mortify themselves. 
Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves. 
These are the five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
Sorrowing and lamenting 
doesn’t do even a little bit of good. 
When they know that you’re sad, 
your enemies are encouraged. 
When an astute person doesn’t waver <j>in the face of adversity, 
as they’re able to assess what’s beneficial, 
their enemies suffer, 
seeing that their normal expression doesn’t change. 
Chants, recitations, fine sayings, 
charity or traditions: 
if by means of any such things you benefit, 
then by all means keep doing them. 
But if you understand that ‘this good thing 
can’t be had by me or by anyone else’, 
you should accept it without sorrowing, thinking: 
‘The karma is strong. What can I do now?’” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )The King of Kosala ^n49 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 

Then a man went up to the king and whispered in his ear, 
“Your Majesty, Queen Mallikā has passed away.” 
When this was said, King Pasenadi was miserable and sad. He sat with his shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. 
Knowing this, the Buddha said to him, 
“Great king, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
What five? 
That someone liable to old age should not grow old. … Sorrowing and lamenting doesn’t do even a little bit of good … ‘The karma is strong. What can I do now?’” 

5. With King Muṇḍa )With Nārada ^n50 At one time Venerable Nārada was staying near Pāṭaliputta, in the Chicken Monastery. 
Now at that time King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā had just passed away. 
And since that time, the king did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or apply himself to his work. 
Day and night he brooded over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse. 
Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka, 
“So, my good Piyaka, please place Queen Bhaddā’s corpse in an iron case filled with oil. Then close it up with another case, so that we can view Queen Bhaddā’s body even longer.” 
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer, and he did as the king instructed. 
Then it occurred to Piyaka, 
“King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā has passed away. 
Since then the king does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or apply himself to his work. 
Day and night he broods over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse. 
Now, what ascetic or brahmin might the king pay homage to, whose teaching could help the king give up sorrow’s arrow?” 
Then it occurred to Piyaka, 
“This Venerable Nārada is staying in the Chicken Monastery at Pāṭaliputta. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’ 
What if King Muṇḍa was to pay homage to Venerable Nārada? Hopefully when he hears Nārada’s teaching, the king could give up sorrow’s arrow.” 
Then Piyaka went to the king and said to him, 
“Sire, this Venerable Nārada is staying in the Chicken Monastery at Pāṭaliputta. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’ 
What if Your Majesty was to pay homage to Venerable Nārada? Hopefully when you hear Nārada’s teaching, you could give up sorrow’s arrow.” 
“Well then, my good Piyaka, let Nārada know. 
For how could one such as I presume to visit an ascetic or brahmin in my realm without first letting them know?” 
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer. He went to Nārada, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā has passed away. 
And since she passed away, the king has not bathed, anointed himself, eaten his meals, or got his business done. 
Day and night he broods over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse. 
Sir, please teach the king so that, when he hears your teaching, he can give up sorrow’s arrow.” 
“Please, Piyaka, let the king come when he likes.” 
Then Piyaka got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Venerable Nārada, keeping him on his right, before going to the king and saying, 
“Sire, the request for an audience with Venerable Nārada has been granted. 
Please, Your Majesty, go at your convenience.” 
“Well then, my good Piyaka, harness the finest chariots.” 
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer. He did so, then told the king: 
“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed. 
Please, Your Majesty, go at your convenience.” 
Then King Muṇḍa mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp to see Venerable Nārada at the Chicken Monastery. 
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. 
Then the king went up to Nārada, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then Nārada said to him: 
“Great king, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. 
What five? 
That someone liable to old age should not grow old. …

When he said this, King Muṇḍa said to Venerable Nārada, 
“Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” 
“Great king, this exposition of the teaching is called ‘Pulling Out Sorrow’s Arrow’.” 
“Indeed, sir, this is the pulling out of sorrow’s arrow! 
Hearing this exposition of the teaching, I’ve given up sorrow’s arrow.” 
Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka, 
“Well then, my good Piyaka, cremate Queen Bhaddā’s corpse and build a monument. 
From this day forth, I will bathe, anoint myself, eat my meals, and apply myself to my work.” 








^ckan#a5f(6. Hindrances )Obstacles ^n51 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, there are these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. 
What five? 
Sensual desire … 
Ill will … 
Dullness and drowsiness … 
Restlessness and remorse … 
Doubt … 
These are the five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. 
Take a mendicant who has feeble and weak wisdom, not having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It’s simply impossible that they would know what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. 
Suppose there was a mountain river that flowed swiftly, going far, carrying all before it. 
But then a man would open channels on both sides, 
so the mid-river current would be dispersed, spread out, and separated. The river would no longer flow swiftly, going far, carrying all before it. 
In the same way, take a mendicant who has feeble and weak wisdom, not having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It’s simply impossible that they would know what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. 
Take a mendicant who has powerful wisdom, having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It’s quite possible that they would know what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. 
Suppose there was a mountain river that flowed swiftly, going far, carrying all before it. 
But then a man would close up the channels on both sides, 
so the mid-river current would not be dispersed, spread out, and separated. The river would keep flowing swiftly for a long way, carrying all before it. 
In the same way, take a mendicant who has powerful wisdom, having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It’s quite possible that they would know what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.” 

6. Hindrances )A Heap of the Unskillful ^n52 “Mendicants, rightly speaking, you’d call the five hindrances a ‘heap of the unskillful’. 
For these five hindrances are entirely a heap of the unskillful. 
What five? 
The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. 
Rightly speaking, you’d call these five hindrances a ‘heap of the unskillful’. 
For these five hindrances are entirely a heap of the unskillful.” 

6. Hindrances )Factors That Support Meditation ^n53 “Mendicants, there are these five factors that support meditation. 
What five? 
It’s when a mendicant has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
They are rarely ill or unwell. 
Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation. 
They’re not devious or deceitful. 
They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions. 
They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. 
They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. 
These are the five factors that support meditation.” 

6. Hindrances )Times Good for Meditation ^n54 “Mendicants, there are five times that are not good for meditation. 
What five? 
Firstly, a mendicant is old, overcome with old age. 
This is the first time that’s not good for meditation. 
Furthermore, a mendicant is sick, overcome by sickness. 
This is the second time that’s not good for meditation. 
Furthermore, there’s a famine, a bad harvest, so it’s hard to get almsfood, and not easy to keep going by collecting alms. 
This is the third time that’s not good for meditation. 
Furthermore, there’s peril from wild savages, and the countryfolk mount their vehicles and flee everywhere. 
This is the fourth time that’s not good for meditation. 
Furthermore, there’s a schism in the Saṅgha. 
When the Saṅgha is split, they abuse, insult, block, and reject each other. 
This doesn’t inspire confidence in those without it, and it causes some with confidence to change their minds. 
This is the fifth time that’s not good for meditation. 
These are the five times that are not good for meditation. 
There are five times that are good for meditation. 
What five? 
Firstly, a mendicant is a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. 
This is the first time that’s good for meditation. 
Furthermore, they are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation. 
This is the second time that’s good for meditation. 
Furthermore, there’s plenty of food, a good harvest, so it’s easy to get almsfood, and easy to keep going by collecting alms. 
This is the third time that’s good for meditation. 
Furthermore, people live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes. 
This is the fourth time that’s good for meditation. 
Furthermore, the Saṅgha lives comfortably, in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, with one recitation. 
When the Saṅgha is in harmony, they don’t abuse, insult, block, or reject each other. 
This inspires confidence in those without it, and increases confidence in those who have it. 
This is the fifth time that’s good for meditation. 
These are the five times that are good for meditation.” 

6. Hindrances )Mother and Son ^n55 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now, at that time a mother and son had both entered the rainy season residence at Sāvatthī, 
as a monk and a nun. 
They wanted to see each other often. 
The mother wanted to see her son often, 
and the son his mother. 
Seeing each other often, they became close. 
Being so close, they became intimate. 
And being intimate, lust overcame them. 
With their minds swamped by lust, without resigning the training and declaring their inability to continue, they had sex. 
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 



“Mendicants, how could that silly man imagine that 
a mother cannot lust for her son, or that a son cannot lust for his mother? 
Compared to the sight of a woman, I do not see a single sight that is so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, and infatuating, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary. 
Sentient beings are lustful, greedy, tied, infatuated, and attached to the sight of a woman. 
They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a woman’s sight. 
Compared to the sound … smell … taste … touch of a woman, I do not see a single touch that is so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, and infatuating, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary. 
Sentient beings are lustful, greedy, tied, infatuated, and attached to the touch of a woman. 
They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a woman’s touch. 
When a woman walks, she occupies a man’s mind. 
When a woman stands … sits … lies down … laughs … speaks … sings … cries … is injured, she occupies a man’s mind. Even when a woman is dead, she occupies a man’s mind. 
For if anyone should be rightly called ‘an all-round snare of Māra’, it’s females. 


You might chat with someone who has knife in hand. 
You might even chat with a goblin. 
You might sit close by a viper, 
whose bite would take your life. 
But never should you chat 
one on one with a female. 
They captivate the unmindful 
with a glance and a smile. 
Or scantily clad, 
they speak charming words. 
It’s not good to sit with such a person, 
even if she’s injured or dead. 
These five kinds of sensual stimulation 
are apparent in a woman’s body: 
sights, sounds, tastes, smells, 
and touches so delightful. 
Those swept away by the flood of sensual pleasures, 
not comprehending them, 
are governed by transmigration—
time and destination, and life after life. 
But those who fully understand sensual pleasures 
live fearing nothing from any quarter. 
They are those in the world who’ve crossed over, 
having reached the ending of defilements.” 

6. Hindrances )Mentor ^n56 Then a mendicant went up to his own mentor, and said, 
“Now, sir, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.” 
Then that mendicant took his pupil to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, this mendicant says this: 
‘Now, sir, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.’” 
“That’s how it is, mendicant, when your sense doors are unguarded, you eat too much, you’re not dedicated to wakefulness, you’re unable to discern skillful qualities, and you don’t pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Your body feels like it’s drugged. You’re disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill your mind. You lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings. 
So you should train like this: 
‘I will guard my sense doors, eat in moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn.’ 
That’s how you should train.” 
When that mendicant had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And that mendicant became one of the perfected. 
When that mendicant had attained perfection, he went up to his own mentor, and said, 
“Now, sir, my body doesn’t feel like it’s drugged. I’m not disorientated, the teachings spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness don’t fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life satisfied, and have no doubts about the teachings.” 
Then that mendicant took his pupil to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, this mendicant says this: 
‘Now, sir, my body doesn’t feel like it’s drugged. I’m not disorientated, the teachings spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness don’t fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life satisfied, and have no doubts about the teachings.’” 
“That’s how it is, mendicant, when your sense doors are guarded, you’re moderate in eating, you’re dedicated to wakefulness, you’re able to discern skillful qualities, and you pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Your body doesn’t feel like it’s drugged. You’re not disorientated, the teachings spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness don’t fill your mind. You lead the spiritual life satisfied, and have no doubts about the teachings. 
So you should train like this: 
‘We will guard our sense doors, eat in moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn.’ 
That’s how you should train.” 

6. Hindrances )Subjects for Regular Reviewing ^n57 “Mendicants, a woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate should often review these five subjects. 
What five? 
‘I am liable to grow old, I am not exempt from old age.’ A woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate should often review this. 
‘I am liable to get sick, I am not exempt from sickness.’ … 
‘I am liable to die, I am not exempt from death.’ … 
‘I must be parted and separated from all I hold dear and beloved.’ … 
‘I am the owner of my deeds and heir to my deeds. Deeds are my womb, my relative, and my refuge. 
I shall be the heir of whatever deeds I do, whether good or bad.’ 
A woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate should often review this. 
What is the advantage for a woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate of often reviewing this: ‘I am liable to grow old, I am not exempt from old age’? 
There are sentient beings who, intoxicated with the vanity of youth, do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. 
Reviewing this subject often, they entirely give up the vanity of youth, or at least reduce it. 
This is the advantage for a woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate of often reviewing this: ‘I am liable to grow old, I am not exempt from old age’.

I shall be the heir of whatever deeds I do, whether good or bad.’ 

Then that noble disciple reflects: 
‘It’s not just me who is liable to grow old, not being exempt from old age. For all sentient beings grow old according to their nature, as long as they come and go, pass away and are reborn.’ 
When they review this subject often, the path is born in them. 
They cultivate, develop, and make much of it. 
By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies. 
‘It’s not just me who is liable to get sick, not being exempt from sickness. For all sentient beings get sick according to their nature, as long as they come and go, pass away and are reborn.’

When they review this subject often, the path is born in them. 
They cultivate, develop, and make much of it. 
By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies. 
For others, sickness is natural, 
and so are old age and death. 
Though this is how their nature is, 
ordinary people feel disgusted. 
If I were to be disgusted 
with creatures whose nature is such, 
it would not be appropriate for me, 
since my life is just the same. 
Living in such a way, 
I understood the reality without attachments. 
I mastered all vanities—
of health, of youth, 
and even of life—
seeing renunciation as sanctuary. 
Zeal sprang up in me 
as I looked to extinguishment. 
Now I’m unable 
to indulge in sensual pleasures; 
there’s no turning back, 
I’m committed to the spiritual life.” 

6. Hindrances )The Licchavi Youths ^n58 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. 
Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, he plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
Now at that time several Licchavi youths took strung bows and, escorted by a pack of hounds, were going for a walk in the Great Wood when they saw the Buddha seated at the root of a tree. 
When they saw him, they put down their strung bows, tied their hounds up to one side, and went up to him. They bowed and silently paid homage to the Buddha with joined palms. 
Now at that time Mahānāma the Licchavi was going for a walk in the Great Wood when he saw those Licchavi youths silently paying homage to the Buddha with joined palms. 
Seeing this, he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, 
and expressed this heartfelt sentiment, 
“They will become Vajjis! They will become Vajjis!” 
“But Mahānāma, why do you say that 
they will become Vajjis?” 
“Sir, these Licchavi youths are violent, harsh, and brash. 
Whenever sweets are left out for families—sugar-cane, jujube fruits, pancakes, pies, or fritters—they filch them and eat them up. 
And they hit women and girls of good families on their backs. 
But now they’re silently paying homage to the Buddha with joined palms.” 

“Mahānāma, you can expect only growth, not decline, when you find five qualities in any gentleman—whether he’s an anointed aristocratic king, an appointed or hereditary official, an army general, a village chief, a guild chief, or a ruler of his own clan. 
What five? 
Firstly, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth—earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow—to honor, respect, esteem, and venerate his mother and father.

‘Live long! Stay alive for a long time!’

and for the good of his wives and children. 
He looks after those in his household, 
and those dependent on him for their livelihood.

looks after the welfare of relatives—
both those who have passed away, 
and those alive at present. 
While living at home, an astute person 
uses legitimate means to give rise to joy 
for ascetics, brahmins, 
and also the gods. 
Having done good, 
he’s venerable and praiseworthy. 
They praise him in this life, 
and he departs to rejoice in heaven.”

8. Warriors )One Who Lives by the Teaching (1st) ^n73 Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, they speak of ‘one who lives by the teaching’. 
How is a mendicant who lives by the teaching defined?”

That’s how a mendicant is one who lives by the teaching. 
So, mendicant, I’ve taught you the one who studies a lot, the one who advocates a lot, the one who recites a lot, the one who thinks a lot, and the one who lives by the teaching. 
Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.

Declaring his inability to continue training, he rejects it and returns to a lesser life. 
What is his ‘cloud of dust’? 
It’s when a monk hears: 
‘In such and such a village or town there’s a women or a girl who is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty.’ 
Hearing this, he falters and founders. He doesn’t stay firm, and fails to keep up the spiritual life. 
Declaring his inability to continue training, he rejects it and returns to a lesser life. 
This is his ‘cloud of dust’. 
I say that this person is like the warrior who falters and founders at the mere sight of a cloud of dust.

But he sees for himself a women or a girl who is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty.

Furthermore, one monk can prevail over a cloud of dust and a banner’s crest and turmoil, and being struck. He wins victory in battle, establishing himself as foremost in battle. 
What is his ‘victory in battle’? 
It’s when a mendicant who has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut is approached by a female. She sits right by him, lies down, or embraces him. 
But he disentangles and frees himself, and goes wherever he wants. 
He frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. 
Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. 
Giving up covetousness for the world, he meditates with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. 
Giving up ill will and malevolence, he meditates with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. 
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, he meditates with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. 
Giving up restlessness and remorse, he meditates without restlessness, his mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. 
Giving up doubt, he meditates having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. 
He gives up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. 
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption … 
second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. 
When his mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. 
He truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
He truly understands: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. 
Knowing and seeing like this, his mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. 
When it is freed, he knows it is freed. 
He understands: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
This is his ‘victory in battle’. 
I say that this person is like the warrior who can prevail over a cloud of dust and a banner’s crest and turmoil and being struck. He wins victory in battle, establishing himself as foremost in battle.

yawns, 
looks all around the four quarters, 
and roars his lion’s roar three times. 
Then he sets out on the hunt. 
If he strikes an elephant, he does it carefully, not carelessly. 
If he strikes a buffalo … 
a cow … 
a leopard … 
or any smaller creatures—even a hare or a cat—he does it carefully, not carelessly. 
Why is that? 
Thinking: ‘May I not lose my way.’ 
‘Lion’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
When the Realized One teaches Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion’s roar. 
When the Realized One teaches the monks … 
nuns … 
laymen … 
laywomen … 
or ordinary people—even food-carriers and hunters—he teaches them carefully, not carelessly. 
Why is that? 
Because the Realized One has respect and reverence for the teaching.” 

10. With Kakudha )With Kakudha ^n100 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
At that time the Koliyan named Kakudha—Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s supporter—had recently passed away and been reborn in a certain host of mind-made gods. 
He was reincarnated in a life-form that was two or three times the size of a Magadhan village with its fields. 
But with that life-form he didn’t obstruct himself or others. 
Then the god Kakudha went up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, this fixed desire arose in Devadatta: 
‘I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha.’ 
And as that thought arose, Devadatta lost that psychic power.” 
That’s what the god Kakudha said. 
Then he bowed and respectfully circled Mahāmoggallāna, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. 
Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 









“But Moggallāna, did you comprehend the god Kakudha’s mind, and know that 
everything he says is correct and not otherwise?” 
“Indeed I did, sir.” 

“Mark these words, Moggallāna! 
Mark these words! 
Now that silly man Devadatta will expose himself by his own deeds. 
Moggallāna, there are these five teachers found in the world. 
What five? 
Firstly, some teacher with impure conduct claims: ‘I am pure in ethics. My ethical conduct is pure, bright, uncorrupted.’ 
But their disciples know: 
‘This teacher has impure ethical conduct, but claims to be ethically pure. 
They wouldn’t like it if we were to tell the laypeople. 
And how could we treat them in a way that they don’t like? 
But they consent to robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
A person will be recognized by their own deeds.’ 
The disciples of such a teacher cover up their teacher’s conduct, 
and the teacher expects them to do so. 
Furthermore, some teacher with impure livelihood claims: ‘I am pure in livelihood. My livelihood is pure, bright, uncorrupted.’ 
But their disciples know: 
‘This teacher has impure livelihood, but claims to have pure livelihood. 
They wouldn’t like it if we were to tell the laypeople.

and the teacher expects them to do so. 
Furthermore, some teacher with impure answers claims: ‘I am pure in how I answer. My answers are pure, bright, uncorrupted.’ 
But their disciples know: 
‘This teacher has impure answers, but claims to have pure answers. 
They wouldn’t like it if we were to tell the laypeople.

A person will be recognized by their own deeds.’ 
The disciples of such a teacher cover up their teacher’s knowledge and vision, 
and the teacher expects them to do so. 
These are the five teachers found in the world. 
But Moggallāna, I have pure ethical conduct, and I claim: ‘I am pure in ethical conduct. My ethical conduct is pure, bright, uncorrupted.’ 
My disciples don’t cover up my conduct, and I don’t expect them to. 
I have pure livelihood, and I claim: ‘I am pure in livelihood. My livelihood is pure, bright, uncorrupted.’ 
My disciples don’t cover up my livelihood, and I don’t expect them to. 
I have pure teaching, and I claim: ‘I am pure in teaching. My teaching is pure, bright, uncorrupted.’ 
My disciples don’t cover up my teaching, and I don’t expect them to. 
I have pure answers, and I claim: ‘I am pure in how I answer. My answers are pure, bright, uncorrupted.’ 
My disciples don’t cover up my answers, and I don’t expect them to. 
I have pure knowledge and vision, and I claim: ‘I am pure in knowledge and vision. My knowledge and vision are pure, bright, uncorrupted.’ 
My disciples don’t cover up my knowledge and vision, and I don’t expect them to.”

A master thief with these five factors breaks into houses, plunders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway robbery. 
In the same way, when a bad mendicant has five qualities, they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they make much bad karma.

It’s when a bad mendicant receives robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
They think: 
‘If anyone accuses me of anything, I’ll settle it with a bribe.’ 
And that’s exactly what happens. 
That’s how a bad mendicant pays bribes. 
And how does a bad mendicant act alone? 
It’s when a bad mendicant dwells alone in the borderlands. 
They visit families there to get material possessions.

11. Living Comfortably )An Exquisite Ascetic of Ascetics ^n104 “Mendicants, a mendicant with five qualities is an exquisite ascetic of ascetics. 
What five? 
It’s when a mendicant usually uses only what they’ve been invited to accept—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—rarely using them without invitation. 
When living with other spiritual practitioners, they usually treat them agreeably by way of body, speech, and mind, and rarely disagreeably. 
And they usually present them with agreeable things, rarely with disagreeable ones. 
They’re healthy, so the various unpleasant feelings—stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction; or caused by change in weather, by not taking care of themselves, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds—usually don’t come up. 
They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. 
And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
A mendicant with these five qualities is an exquisite ascetic of ascetics. 
And if anyone should be rightly called an exquisite ascetic of ascetics, it’s me. 
For I usually use only what I’ve been invited to accept. 
When living with other spiritual practitioners, I usually treat them agreeably. 
And I usually present them with agreeable things.

So if anyone should be rightly called an exquisite ascetic of ascetics, it’s me.”

In the same way, a mendicant with five qualities lives with mind freed, no matter what region they live in.

It’s when mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
This is like the anointed aristocratic king’s impeccable lineage. 
They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. 
This is like the anointed aristocratic king being rich, affluent, and wealthy, with full treasury and storehouses. 
They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. 
This is like the anointed aristocratic king having power. 
They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. 
This is like the anointed aristocratic king having a counselor. 
These four qualities bring their freedom to fruition. 
With these five qualities, including freedom, they live in their own realm, no matter what region they live in. 
Why is that? 
Because that is how it is for those whose mind is free.”

Take the case of the person who transgresses and regrets it. 
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
They should be told: 
‘Venerable, the defilements born of transgression are found in you, and the defilements born of regret grow. You would do well to give up the defilements born of transgression and get rid of the defilements born of regret, and then develop the mind and wisdom. 
In this way you’ll become just like the fifth person.’

15. At Tikaṇḍakī )At Sārandada ^n143 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. 
Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the Sārandada shrine, and this discussion came up among them, 
“The appearance of five treasures is rare in the world. 
What five? 
The elephant-treasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the woman-treasure, and the householder-treasure. 
The appearance of these five treasures is rare in the world.” 
Then those Licchavis sent a man out on to the road, saying, 
“Mister, please tell us when you see the Buddha.” 
That man saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. 
He went to the Licchavis and said, 
“Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming. 
Please go at your convenience.” 
Then those Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“Please go to the Sārandada shrine, out of compassion.” 
The Buddha consented with silence. 
Then the Buddha went up to the Sārandada shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out, and said to the Licchavis, 
“Licchavis, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” 
“Well, Master Gotama, this discussion came up among us while we were sitting together: 
‘The appearance of five treasures is rare in the world. …’” 



“You Licchavis are so fixated on sensual pleasures, that’s the only discussion that came up! 
Licchavis, the appearance of five treasures is rare in the world. 
What five? 
The appearance of a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. 
A person who explains the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One. 
A person who understands the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One. 
A person who practices in line with the teaching. 
A person who is grateful and thankful. 
The appearance of these five treasures is rare in the world.” 

15. At Tikaṇḍakī )At Tikaṇḍakī ^n144 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa, in Tikaṇḍakī Wood. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, a mendicant would do well to meditate from time to time perceiving the following: the repulsive in the unrepulsive, 
the unrepulsive in the repulsive, 
the repulsive in both the unrepulsive and the repulsive, and 
the unrepulsive in both the repulsive and the unrepulsive. 
A mendicant would do well to meditate from time to time staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive. 
For what reason should a mendicant meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive? 
‘May greed not arise in me for things that arouse greed.’ 
A mendicant should meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive for this reason. 
For what reason should a mendicant meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive? 
‘May hate not arise in me for things that provoke hate.’ … 

For what reason should a mendicant meditate perceiving the repulsive in both the unrepulsive and the repulsive? 
‘May greed not arise in me for things that arouse greed. May hate not arise in me for things that provoke hate.’ … 

For what reason should a mendicant meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in both the repulsive and the unrepulsive? 
‘May hate not arise in me for things that provoke hate. May greed not arise in me for things that arouse greed.’ … 

For what reason should a mendicant meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive? 
‘May no greed for things that arouse greed, hate for things that provoke hate, or delusion for things that promote delusion arise in me in any way at all.’ 
For this reason a mendicant should meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.”

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
Now, at that time Venerable Udāyī was sitting teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople. 
Seeing this, Venerable Ānanda 
went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, Venerable Udāyī is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople.” 
“Ānanda, it’s not easy to teach Dhamma to others. 
You should establish five things in yourself before teaching Dhamma to others. 
What five? 
You should teach Dhamma to others thinking: ‘I will teach step by step.’ … 
‘I will teach showing my method.’ … 
‘I will teach out of kindness.’ … 
‘I will not teach while secretly hoping to profit.’ … 
‘I will teach without hurting myself or others.’

How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of body is impure, but whose behavior by way of speech is pure? 
Suppose a mendicant wearing rag robes sees a rag by the side of the road. They’d hold it down with the left foot, spread it out with the right foot, tear out what was intact, and take it away with them. 
In the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of body and focus on their pure behavior by way of speech. 
That’s how to get rid of resentment for that person.

Suppose there was a little water in a cow’s hoofprint.

They might think: 
‘This little bit of water is in a cow’s hoofprint. 
If I drink it with my cupped hands or a bowl, I’ll stir it and disturb it, making it undrinkable. 
Why don’t I get down on all fours and drink it up like a cow, then be on my way?’ 
So that’s what they do. 
In the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of speech and body, 

and focus on the fact that they get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time.

Suppose a person was traveling along a road, and they were sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
And it was a long way to a village, whether ahead or behind. 
And they didn’t have any suitable food or medicine, or a competent carer, or someone to bring them within a village. 
Then another person traveling along the road sees them, 
and thinks of them with nothing but compassion, kindness, and sympathy: 
‘Oh, may this person get suitable food or medicine, or a competent carer, or someone to bring them within a village. 
Why is that? 
So that they don’t come to ruin right here.’ 
In the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of speech and body, and the fact that they don’t get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time, and think of them with nothing but compassion, kindness, and sympathy:

Why is that? 
So that, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re not reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’

How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of body and speech is pure, and who gets an openness and clarity of heart from time to time? 
Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful, and shaded by many trees. 
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. 
They’d plunge into the lotus pond to bathe and drink. And after emerging they’d sit or lie down right there in the shade of the trees. 
In the same way, at that time you should focus on that person’s pure behavior by way of body and speech, and on the fact that they get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time.

17. Resentment )Discussions ^n163 There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, mendicants!” 
“Reverend,” they replied. 
Sāriputta said this: 
“A mendicant with five qualities is fit to hold a discussion with their spiritual companions. 
What five? 
A mendicant is personally accomplished in ethics, and answers questions that come up when discussing accomplishment in ethics. 
They’re personally accomplished in immersion, … 
They’re personally accomplished in wisdom, … 
They’re personally accomplished in freedom, … 
They’re personally accomplished in the knowledge and vision of freedom, and they answer questions that come up when discussing accomplishment in the knowledge and vision of freedom.

17. Resentment )Asking Questions ^n165 There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: … “Whoever asks a question of another, does so for one or other of these five reasons. 
What five? 
Someone asks a question of another from stupidity and folly. Or they ask from corrupt wishes, being of wishful temperament. Or they ask in order to disparage. Or they ask wanting to understand. Or they ask with the thought, 
‘If they correctly answer the question I ask it’s good. If not, I’ll correctly answer it for them.’ 
Whoever asks a question of another, does so for one or other of these five reasons. 
As for myself, I ask with the thought, 
‘If they correctly answer the question I ask it’s good. If not, I’ll correctly answer it for them.’” 

17. Resentment )Cessation ^n166 There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom. They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. 
That is possible. 
If they don’t reach enlightenment in this very life, then, surpassing the company of gods that consume solid food, they’re reborn in a certain host of mind-made gods. There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. 
That is possible.” 
When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him, 
“This is not possible, Reverend Sāriputta, it cannot happen!” 

But for a second … and a third time Sāriputta repeated his statement. 




And for a third time, Udāyī said to him, 
“This is not possible, Reverend Sāriputta, it cannot happen!” 

Then Venerable Sāriputta thought, 
“Venerable Udāyī disagrees with me three times, and not one mendicant agrees with me. 
Why don’t I go to see the Buddha?” 
Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, 
and said to the mendicants: 
“Reverends, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom. They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. 
There is such a possibility. 
If they don’t reach enlightenment in this very life, they’re reborn in the company of a certain host of mind-made gods, who surpass the gods that consume solid food. There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. 
That is possible.” 
When he said this, Udāyī said to him, 
“This is not possible, Reverend Sāriputta, it cannot happen!” 

But for a second … and a third time Sāriputta repeated his statement. 




And for a third time, Udāyī said to him, 
“This is not possible, Reverend Sāriputta, it cannot happen!” 

Then Venerable Sāriputta thought, 
“Even in front of the Buddha Venerable Udāyī disagrees with me three times, and not one mendicant agrees with me. 
I’d better stay silent.” 
Then Sāriputta fell silent. 
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Udāyī, 
“But Udāyī, do you believe in a mind-made body?” 
“For those gods, sir, who are formless, made of perception.” 
“Udāyī, what has an incompetent fool like you got to say? 
How on earth could you imagine you’ve got something worth saying!” 
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, 
“Ānanda! There’s a senior mendicant being harassed, and you just watch it happening. 
Don’t you have any compassion for a senior mendicant who is being harassed?” 
Then the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom. They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. 
That is possible. 
If they don’t reach enlightenment in this very life, they’re reborn in the company of a certain host of mind-made gods, who surpass the gods that consume solid food. There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. 
That is possible.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 
Then, not long after the Buddha had left, Venerable Ānanda went to Venerable Upavāna and said to him, 
“Reverend Upavāna, they’ve been harassing other senior mendicants, 
but I didn’t question them. 
I wouldn’t be surprised if the Buddha brings this up when he comes out of retreat later this afternoon. He might even call upon Venerable Upavāna himself. 
And right now I feel timid.” 
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out, and said to Upavāna, 
“Upavāna, how many qualities should a senior mendicant have to be dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired?” 
“Sir, a senior mendicant with five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired. 
What five? 
It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. 
They’re a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. 
They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. 
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
A senior mendicant with these five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired.” 
“Good, good, Upavāna! 
A senior mendicant with these five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired. 
If these five qualities are not found in a senior mendicant, why would their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, or venerate them? Because of their broken teeth, gray hair, and wrinkled skin? 
But since these five qualities are found in a senior mendicant, their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, or venerate them.” 

17. Resentment )Accusation ^n167 There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should first establish five things in themselves. 
What five? 
I will speak at the right time, not at the wrong time. 
I will speak truthfully, not falsely. 
I will speak gently, not harshly. 
I will speak beneficially, not harmfully. 
I will speak lovingly, not from secret hate. 
A mendicant who wants to accuse another should first establish these five things in themselves. 
Take a case where I see a certain person being accused at the wrong time, not being disturbed at the right time. They’re accused falsely, not disturbed truthfully. They’re accused harshly, not disturbed gently. They’re accused harmfully, not disturbed beneficially. They’re accused with secret hate, not disturbed lovingly. 
The mendicant who is accused improperly should be reassured in five ways. 
‘Venerable, you were accused at the wrong time, not at the right time. There’s no need for you to feel remorse. 
You were accused falsely, not truthfully. … 
You were accused harshly, not gently. … 
You were accused harmfully, not beneficially. … 
You were accused with secret hate, not lovingly. There’s no need for you to feel remorse.’ 
A mendicant who is accused improperly should be reassured in these five ways. 
The mendicant who makes improper accusations should be chastened in five ways. 
‘Reverend, you made an accusation at the wrong time, not at the right time. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse. 
You made an accusation falsely, not truthfully. … 
You made an accusation harshly, not gently. … 
You made an accusation harmfully, not beneficially. … 
You made an accusation with secret hate, not lovingly. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse.’ 
The mendicant who makes improper accusations should be chastened in these five ways. 
Why is that? 
So that another mendicant wouldn’t think to make a false accusation. 
Take a case where I see a certain person being accused at the right time, not being disturbed at the wrong time. They’re accused truthfully, not disturbed falsely. They’re accused gently, not disturbed harshly. They’re accused beneficially, not disturbed harmfully. They’re accused lovingly, not disturbed with secret hate. 
The mendicant who is accused properly should be chastened in five ways. 
‘Venerable, you were accused at the right time, not at the wrong time. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse. 
You were accused truthfully, not falsely. … 
You were accused gently, not harshly. … 
You were accused beneficially, not harmfully. … 
You were accused lovingly, not with secret hate. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse.’ 
The mendicant who is accused properly should be chastened in these five ways. 
The mendicant who makes proper accusations should be reassured in five ways. 
‘Reverend, you made an accusation at the right time, not at the wrong time. There’s no need for you to feel remorse. 
You made an accusation truthfully, not falsely. … 
You made an accusation gently, not harshly. … 
You made an accusation beneficially, not harmfully. … 
You made an accusation lovingly, not with secret hate. There’s no need for you to feel remorse.’ 
The mendicant who makes proper accusations should be reassured in these five ways. 
Why is that? 
So that another mendicant would think to make a true accusation. 
A person who is accused should ground themselves in two things: 
truth and an even temper. 
Even if others accuse me—at the right time or the wrong time, truthfully or falsely, gently or harshly, beneficially or harmfully, lovingly or with secret hate—I will still ground myself in two things: 
truth and an even temper. 
If I know that 
that quality is found in me, I will tell them that it is. 

If I know that 
that quality is not found in me, I will tell them that it is not.” 

“Even when you speak like this, Sāriputta, there are still some foolish people here who do not respectfully take it up.” 
“Sir, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and stupid. When I speak to them like this, they don’t respectfully take it up. 
Sir, there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are dedicated to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise, not stupid. When I speak to them like this, they do respectfully take it up.” 
“Sāriputta, those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood … Leave them be. 
But those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith … You should speak to them. 
Sāriputta, you should advise your spiritual companions! 
You should instruct your spiritual companions! 
Thinking: ‘I will draw my spiritual companions away from false teachings and ground them in true teachings.’ 
That’s how you should train.” 

17. Resentment )Ethics ^n168 There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, an unethical person, who lacks ethics, has destroyed a vital condition for right immersion. 
When there is no right immersion, one who lacks right immersion has destroyed a vital condition for true knowledge and vision. 
When there is no true knowledge and vision, one who lacks true knowledge and vision has destroyed a vital condition for disillusionment and dispassion. 
When there is no disillusionment and dispassion, one who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom. 
Suppose there was a tree that lacked branches and foliage. 
Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would not grow to fullness. 
In the same way, an unethical person, who lacks ethics, has destroyed a vital condition for right immersion. 
When there is no right immersion, one who lacks right immersion has destroyed a vital condition for true knowledge and vision. 
When there is no true knowledge and vision, one who lacks true knowledge and vision has destroyed a vital condition for disillusionment and dispassion. 
When there is no disillusionment and dispassion, one who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom. 
An ethical person, who has fulfilled ethics, has fulfilled a vital condition for right immersion. 
When there is right immersion, one who has fulfilled right immersion has fulfilled a vital condition for true knowledge and vision. 
When there is true knowledge and vision, one who has fulfilled true knowledge and vision has fulfilled a vital condition for disillusionment and dispassion. 
When there is disillusionment and dispassion, one who has fulfilled disillusionment and dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom. 
Suppose there was a tree that was complete with branches and foliage. Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would grow to fullness. 
In the same way, an ethical person, who has fulfilled ethics, has fulfilled a vital condition for right immersion. 
When there is right immersion, one who has fulfilled right immersion has fulfilled a vital condition for true knowledge and vision. 
When there is true knowledge and vision, one who has fulfilled true knowledge and vision has fulfilled a vital condition for disillusionment and dispassion. 
When there is disillusionment and dispassion, one who has fulfilled disillusionment and dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.” 

17. Resentment )Quick-witted ^n169 Then Venerable Ānanda went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him: 
“Reverend Sāriputta, how are we to define a mendicant who is quick-witted when it comes to skillful teachings, who learns well, learns much, and does not forget what they’ve learned?” 
“Well, Venerable Ānanda, you’re very learned. 
Why don’t you clarify this yourself?” 
“Well then, Reverend Sāriputta, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied. 
Venerable Ānanda said this: 
“It’s when a mendicant is skilled in the meaning, skilled in the teaching, skilled in terminology, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence. 
That is how to define a mendicant who is quick-witted when it comes to skillful teachings, who learns well, learns much, and does not forget what they’ve learned.” 
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
How well this was said by Venerable Ānanda! 
And we will remember Venerable Ānanda as someone who has these five qualities: 
‘Reverend Ānanda is skilled in the meaning, skilled in the teaching, skilled in terminology, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence.’” 

17. Resentment )With Bhaddaji ^n170 At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
Then Venerable Bhaddaji went up to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and Venerable Ānanda said to him: 
“Reverend Bhaddaji, what is the best sight, the best sound, the best happiness, the best perception, and the best state of existence?” 
“Reverend, there is this Brahmā, the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power. When you see Brahmā, that’s the best sight. 
There are the gods called ‘of streaming radiance’, who are drenched and steeped in pleasure. 
Every so often they feel inspired to exclaim: 
‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’ 
When you hear that, it’s the best sound. 
There are the gods called ‘replete with glory’. 
Since they’re truly content, they experience pleasure. This is the best happiness. 
There are the gods reborn in the dimension of nothingness. This is the best perception. 
There are the gods reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the best state of existence.” 
“So, Venerable Bhaddaji, do you agree with what most people say about this?” 
“Well, Venerable Ānanda, you’re very learned. 
Why don’t you clarify this yourself?” 
“Well then, Reverend Bhaddaji, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, reverend,” Bhaddaji replied. 
Ānanda said this: 
“What you see when the defilements end in the present life is the best sight. 
What you hear when the defilements end in the present life is the best sound. 
The happiness you feel when the defilements end in the present life is the best happiness. 
What you perceive when the defilements end in the present life is the best perception. 
The state of existence in which the defilements end in the present life is the best state of existence.” 







^ckan#a5r(18. A Lay Follower )Timidity ^n171 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“A lay follower with five qualities is overcome by timidity. 
What five? 
They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, and use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
A lay follower with these five qualities is overcome by timidity. 
A lay follower with five qualities is self-assured. 
What five? 
They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
A lay follower with these five qualities is self-assured.” 

18. A Lay Follower )Assured ^n172 “A lay follower living at home with five qualities is not self-assured. 
What five? 
They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, and use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
A lay follower living at home with these five qualities is not self-assured. 
A lay follower living at home with these five qualities is self-assured. 
What five? 
They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
A lay follower living at home with these five qualities is self-assured.” 

18. A Lay Follower )Hell ^n173 “Mendicants, a lay follower with five qualities is cast down to hell. 
What five? 
They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, and use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
A lay follower with these five qualities is cast down to hell. 
A lay follower with five qualities is raised up to heaven. 
What five? 
They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
A lay follower with these five qualities is raised up to heaven.” 

18. A Lay Follower )Threats ^n174 Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Householder, unless these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be unethical, and is reborn in hell. 
What five? 
Killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
Unless these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be unethical, and is reborn in hell. 
Once these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be ethical, and is reborn in heaven. 
What five? 
Killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
Once these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be ethical, and is reborn in heaven. 
Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness. 
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures. 
Anyone who steals … 
Anyone who commits sexual misconduct … 
Anyone who lies … 
Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness. 
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
Take anyone in this world 
who kills living creatures, 
speaks falsely, steals, 
commits adultery, 
and indulges in drinking 
alcohol and liquor. 
Unless they give up these five threats, 
they’re said to be unethical. 
When their body breaks up, that witless person 
is reborn in hell. 
A person in the world doesn’t kill living creatures, 
speak falsely, 
steal, 
commit adultery, 
or indulge in drinking 
alcohol and liquor. 
Giving up these five threats, 
they’re said to be ethical. 
When their body breaks up, that wise person 
is reborn in a good place.” 

18. A Lay Follower )Outcaste ^n175 “Mendicants, a lay follower with five qualities is an outcaste, a stain, and a reject among lay followers. 
What five? 
They’re faithless. 
They’re unethical. 
They practice noisy, superstitious rites, believing in omens rather than deeds. 
They seek outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy of religious donations. 
And they make offerings there first. 
A lay follower with these five qualities is an outcaste, a stain, and a reject among lay followers. 
A lay follower with five qualities is a gem, a pink lotus, and a white lotus among lay followers. 
What five? 
They’re faithful. 
They’re ethical. 
They don’t practice noisy, superstitious rites, and believe in deeds rather than omens. 
They don’t seek outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy of religious donations. 
And they don’t make offerings there first. 
A lay follower with these five qualities is a gem, a pink lotus, and a white lotus among lay followers.” 

18. A Lay Follower )Rapture ^n176 Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, escorted by around five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Householders, you have supplied the mendicant Saṅgha with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
But you should not be content with just this much. 

So you should train like this: 
‘How can we, from time to time, enter and dwell in the rapture of seclusion?’ 
That’s how you should train.” 
When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Buddha, 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
How well said this was by the Buddha: 
‘Householders, you have supplied the mendicant Saṅgha with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
But you should not be content with just this much. 

So you should train like this: 
“How can we, from time to time, enter and dwell in the rapture of seclusion?” 
That’s how you should train.’ 
At a time when a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of seclusion, five things aren’t present in him. 
The pain and sadness connected with sensual pleasures. 
The pleasure and happiness connected with sensual pleasures. 
The pain and sadness connected with the unskillful. 
The pleasure and happiness connected with the unskillful. 
The pain and sadness connected with the skillful. 
At a time when a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of seclusion, these five things aren’t present in him.” 
“Good, good, Sāriputta! 
At a time when a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of seclusion, five things aren’t present in him. 
The pain and sadness connected with sensual pleasures. 
The pleasure and happiness connected with sensual pleasures. 
The pain and sadness connected with the unskillful. 
The pleasure and happiness connected with the unskillful. 
The pain and sadness connected with the skillful. 
At a time when a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of seclusion, these five things aren’t present in him.” 

18. A Lay Follower )Trades ^n177 “Mendicants, a lay follower should not engage in these five trades. 
What five? 
Trade in weapons, living creatures, meat, intoxicants, and poisons. 
A lay follower should not engage in these five trades.” 

18. A Lay Follower )Kings ^n178 “What do you think, mendicants? 
Have you ever seen or heard 
of a person who has given up killing living creatures, 
and then the kings have them arrested for that, and execute, imprison, or banish them, or do what the case requires?” 
“No, sir.” 
“Good, mendicants! 
I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. 


Rather, the kings are informed of someone’s bad deed: 
‘This person has murdered a man or a woman.’ 
Then the kings have them arrested for killing, and execute, imprison, or banish them, or do what the case requires. 
Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?” 
“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” 
“What do you think, mendicants? 
Have you ever seen or heard 
of a person who has given up stealing, 
and then the kings have them arrested for that …?” 
“No, sir.” 
“Good, mendicants! 
I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. 


Rather, the kings are informed of someone’s bad deed: 
‘This person took something from a village or wilderness, with the intention to commit theft.’ 
Then the kings have them arrested for stealing … 
Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?” 
“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” 
“What do you think, mendicants? 
Have you ever seen or heard 
of a person who has given up sexual misconduct, 
and then the kings have them arrested for that …?” 
“No, sir.” 
“Good, mendicants! 
I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. 


Rather, the kings are informed of someone’s bad deed: 
‘This person had sexual relations with women or maidens under someone else’s protection.’ 
Then the kings have them arrested for that … 
Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?” 
“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” 
“What do you think, mendicants? 
Have you ever seen or heard 
of a person who has given up lying, 
and then the kings have them arrested for that …?” 
“No, sir.” 
“Good, mendicants! 
I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. 


Rather, the kings are informed of someone’s bad deed: 
‘This person has ruined a householder or householder’s child by lying.’ 
Then the kings have them arrested for that … 
Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?” 
“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” 
“What do you think, mendicants?

“No, sir.” 
“Good, mendicants! 
I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. 


Rather, the kings are informed of someone’s bad deed: 
‘While under the influence of alcoholic drinks that cause negligence, this person murdered a woman or a man. 
Or they stole something from a village or wilderness. 
Or they had sexual relations with women or maidens under someone else’s protection. 
Or they ruined a householder or householder’s child by lying.’ 
Then the kings have them arrested for being under the influence of alcoholic drinks that cause negligence, and execute, imprison, or banish them, or do what the case requires. 
Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?” 
“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” 

18. A Lay Follower )A Layperson ^n179 Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, escorted by around five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta: 
“You should know this, Sāriputta, about those white-clothed laypeople whose actions are restrained in the five precepts, and who get four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind when they want, without trouble or difficulty. They may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 
And what are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained? 
It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
These are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained. 
And what are the four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty? 
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
This is the first blissful meditation in the present life belonging to the higher mind, which they achieve in order to purify the unpurified mind and cleanse the unclean mind. 
Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching: 
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 
This is the second blissful meditation … 
Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ 
This is the third blissful meditation … 
Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. 
This is the fourth blissful meditation in the present life belonging to the higher mind, which they achieve in order to purify the unpurified mind and cleanse the unclean mind. 
These are the four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty. 
You should know this, Sāriputta, about those white-clothed laypeople whose actions are restrained in the five precepts, and who get four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind when they want, without trouble or difficulty. They may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 
Seeing the peril in the hells, 
you should shun bad deeds. 
Taking up the teaching of the noble ones, 
an astute person should shun them. 
You shouldn’t harm living beings, 
so long as strength is found. 
Nor should you knowingly speak falsehood, 
or take what is not given. 
Content with your own partners, 
you should stay away from the partners of others. 
A man shouldn’t drink liquor or wine, 
as they confuse the mind. 
You should recollect the Buddha, 
and reflect on the teaching. 
You should develop a harmless mind of welfare, 
which leads to the realms of gods. 
When suitable gifts to give are available 
to someone who seeks and needs merit, 
a religious donation is abundant 
if given first to the peaceful ones. 
I will tell of the peaceful ones, 
Sāriputta, listen to me. 
Cows may be black or white, 
red or tawny, 
mottled or uniform, 
or pigeon-colored. 
But when one is born among them, 
the bull that’s tamed—
a behemoth, powerful, 
well-paced in pulling forward—
they yoke the load just to him, 
regardless of his color. 
So it is for humans, 
wherever they may be born—
among aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, 
menials, or outcastes and scavengers—
but when one is born among them, 
tamed, true to their vows. 
Firm in principle, accomplished in ethical conduct, 
truthful, conscientious, 
they’ve given up birth and death, 
and have completed the spiritual journey. 
With burden put down, detached, 
they’ve completed the task <j>and are free of defilements. 
Gone beyond all things, 
they’re extinguished by not grasping. 
In that flawless field, 
a religious donation is abundant. 
Fools who don’t understand—
stupid, unlearned—
give their gifts to those outside, 
and don’t attend the peaceful ones. 
But those who do attend the peaceful ones—
wise, esteemed as sages—
and whose faith in the Holy One 
has roots planted deep, 
they go to the realm of the gods, 
or are born here in a good family. 
Gradually those astute ones 
reach extinguishment.” 

18. A Lay Follower )About Gavesī ^n180 At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. 
While traveling along a road the Buddha saw a large sal grove in a certain spot. 
He left the road, went to the sal grove, and plunged deep into it. And at a certain spot he smiled. 
Then Venerable Ānanda thought, 
“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled? 
Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.” 
So Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled? 
Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.” 
“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a city in this spot that was successful and prosperous and full of people. 
And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by that city. 
He had a lay follower called Gavesī who had not fulfilled all the precepts. 
And the five hundred lay followers who were taught and advised by Gavesī also had not fulfilled all the precepts. 
Then Gavesī thought: 
‘I’m the helper, leader, and adviser of these five hundred lay followers, yet neither I nor they have fulfilled the precepts. 
We’re the same, I’m in no way better. 
So let me do better.’ 
Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them: 
‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who has fulfilled the precepts.’ 
Then those five hundred lay followers thought: 
‘The venerable Gavesī is our helper, leader, and adviser, 
and now he will fulfill the precepts. 
Why don’t we do the same?’ 
Then those five hundred lay followers went to Gavesī and said to him: 
‘From this day forth may Venerable Gavesī remember these five hundred lay followers as having fulfilled the precepts.’ 
Then Gavesī thought: 
‘I’m the helper, leader, and adviser of these five hundred lay followers, and both I and they have fulfilled the precepts. 
We’re the same, I’m in no way better. 
So let me do better.’ 
Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them: 
‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who is celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.’ 
Then those five hundred lay followers did the same. … 





Then Gavesī thought: 
‘These five hundred lay followers … 



are celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. 
We’re the same, I’m in no way better. 
So let me do better.’ 
Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them: 
‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who eats in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and from food at the wrong time.’ 
Then those five hundred lay followers did the same. … 





Then Gavesī thought: 
‘These five hundred lay followers … 





eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and food at the wrong time. 
We’re the same, I’m in no way better. 
So let me do better.’ 
Then the lay follower Gavesī went up to the blessed one Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha and said to him: 
‘Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?’ 
And he received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
Not long after his ordination, the mendicant Gavesī, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
And the mendicant Gavesī became one of the perfected. 
Then those five hundred lay followers thought: 
‘Venerable Gavesī is our helper, leader, and adviser, 
He has shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
Why don’t we do the same?’ 
Then those five hundred lay followers went up to the blessed one Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha and said to him: 
‘Sir, may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence?’ 
And they did receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
Then the mendicant Gavesī thought: 
‘I get the supreme bliss of freedom whenever I want, without trouble or difficulty. 
Oh, may these five hundred mendicants do the same!’ 
Then those five hundred mendicants, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 

They understood: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
And so, Ānanda, those five hundred mendicants headed by Gavesī, trying to go higher and higher, better and better, realized the supreme bliss of freedom. 
So you should train like this: 
‘Trying to go higher and higher, better and better, we will realize the supreme bliss of freedom.’ 
That’s how you should train.”

A person may be wilderness dweller because of stupidity and folly. Or because of corrupt wishes, being of wishful temperament. Or because of madness and mental disorder.

But the person who dwells in the wilderness for the sake of having few wishes is the foremost, best, chief, highest, and finest of the five.

^ckan#a5t(20. Brahmins )Dogs ^n191 “Mendicants, these five ancient traditions of the brahmins are exhibited these days among dogs, but not among brahmins.

In the past brahmins had sex only with brahmin women, not with others. 
These days brahmins have sex with both brahmin women and others. 
But these days dogs have sex only with female dogs, not with other species. 
This is the first ancient tradition of the brahmins exhibited these days among dogs, but not among brahmins. 
In the past brahmins had sex only with brahmin women in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle, not at other times. 
These days brahmins have sex with brahmin women both in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle and at other times. 
But these days dogs have sex only with female dogs when they are in heat, not at other times. 
This is the second ancient tradition of the brahmins exhibited these days among dogs, but not among brahmins. 
In the past brahmins neither bought nor sold brahmin women. They lived together because they loved each other and wanted their family line to continue. 
These days brahmins both buy and sell brahmin women. They live together whether they love each other or not and they want their family line to continue. 
But these days dogs neither buy nor sell female dogs. They live together because they’re attracted to each other and want their family line to continue.

These five ancient traditions of the brahmins are exhibited these days among dogs, but not among brahmins.” 

20. Brahmins )With the Brahmin Doṇa ^n192 Then Doṇa the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Doṇa sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, I have heard that 
the ascetic Gotama doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. 
And this is indeed the case, 
for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. 
This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.” 
“Doṇa, do you too claim to be a brahmin?” 
“Master Gotama, if anyone should be rightly called 
a brahmin, it’s me. 


For I am well born on both my mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. I recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. I know philology and grammar, and am well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.” 
“Doṇa, the ancient brahmin hermits were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns, whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times. These days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it. They continue chanting what was chanted, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught. 
Those seers described five kinds of brahmins. 
A brahmin who is equal to Brahmā, one who is equal to a god, one who toes the line, one who crosses the line, and the fifth is a brahmin outcaste. 
Which one of these are you, Doṇa?” 
“Master Gotama, we don’t know about these five kinds of brahmins. We just know the word ‘brahmin’. 
Master Gotama, please teach me this matter so I can learn about these five brahmins.” 
“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes sir,” Doṇa replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Doṇa, how is a brahmin equal to Brahmā? 
It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides, coming from a clean womb back to the seventh paternal generation, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy. 

For forty-eight years he leads the boy’s spiritual life studying the hymns. 
Then he seeks a fee for his teacher, but only by legitimate means, not illegitimate. 
In this context, Doṇa, what is legitimate? 
Not by farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions, but solely by living on alms, not scorning the alms bowl. 
Having offered the fee to his teacher, he shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … 
rejoicing … 
equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
Having developed these four Brahmā meditations, when the body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a Brahmā realm. 
That’s how a brahmin is equal to Brahmā. 
And how is a brahmin equal to a god? 
It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides … 





Having offered the fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife, but only by legitimate means, not illegitimate. 
In this context, Doṇa, what is legitimate? 
Not by buying or selling, he only accepts a brahmin woman by the pouring of water. 
He has sex only with a brahmin woman. He does not have sex with a woman from a caste of aristocrats, peasants, menials, outcastes, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors. Nor does he have sex with women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or outside the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. 
And why does the brahmin not have sex with a pregnant woman? 
If a brahmin had sex with a pregnant woman, the boy or girl would be born in too much filth. 
That’s why the brahmin doesn’t have sex with a pregnant woman. 
And why does the brahmin not have sex with a breastfeeding woman? 
If a brahmin had sex with a breastfeeding woman, the boy or girl would drink back the semen. 
That’s why the brahmin doesn’t have sex with a breastfeeding woman. 
And why does the brahmin not have sex outside the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle? Because his brahmin wife is not there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, but only for procreation. 
Having ensured his progeny through sex, he shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
When he has gone forth, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. 
Having developed these four absorptions, when the body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
That’s how a brahmin is equal to god. 
And how does a brahmin toe the line? 
It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides … 







Not by buying or selling, he only accepts a brahmin woman by the pouring of water. 








Having ensured his progeny through sex, his child makes him happy. Because of this attachment he stays in his family property, and does not go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
As far as the line of the ancient brahmins extends, he doesn’t cross over it. 
That’s why he’s called a brahmin who toes the line. 
That’s how a brahmin toes the line. 
And how does a brahmin cross the line? 
It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides … 





Having offered a fee for his teacher, he seeks a wife by both legitimate and illegitimate means. That is, by buying or selling, as well as accepting a brahmin woman by the pouring of water.

His brahmin wife is there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, as well as for procreation. 
As far as the line of the ancient brahmins extends, he crosses over it. 
That’s why he’s called a brahmin who crosses the line. 
That’s how a brahmin crosses the line. 
And how is a brahmin a brahmin outcaste? 
It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides, coming from a clean womb back to the seventh paternal generation, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy. 

For forty-eight years he leads the virginal spiritual life studying the hymns. 
Then he seeks a fee for his teacher by legitimate means and illegitimate means. 
By farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions, not solely by living on alms, not scorning the alms bowl.

His brahmin wife is there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, as well as for procreation. 
He earns a living by any kind of work. 
The brahmins say to him, 
‘My good man, why is it that you claim to be a brahmin, but you earn a living by any kind of work?’ 
He says, 
‘It’s like a fire that burns both pure and filthy substances, but doesn’t become corrupted by them. 
In the same way, my good man, if a brahmin earns a living by any kind of work, he is not corrupted by that.’ 
A brahmin is called a brahmin outcaste because he earns a living by any kind of work. 
That’s how a brahmin is a brahmin outcaste. 
Doṇa, the ancient brahmin hermits were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu.

A brahmin who is equal to Brahmā, one who is equal to a god, one who toes the line, one who crosses the line, and the fifth is a brahmin outcaste. 
Which one of these are you, Doṇa?” 
“This being so, Master Gotama, I don’t even qualify as a brahmin outcaste. 
Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

20. Brahmins )With Saṅgārava ^n193 Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Saṅgārava sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 
“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why sometimes even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced? 
And why is it that sometimes even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced?” 
“Brahmin, there’s a time when your heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire and you don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. At that time you don’t truly know or see what is good for yourself, good for another, or good for both. Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. 
Suppose there was a bowl of water that was mixed with dye such as red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder. 
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it. 
In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. 
Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in ill will … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. 
Suppose there was a bowl of water that was heated by fire, boiling and bubbling.

Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in dullness and drowsiness … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced.

Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in restlessness and remorse … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. 
Suppose there was a bowl of water stirred by the wind, churning, swirling, and rippling. 
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it. 
In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in restlessness and remorse … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. 
Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in doubt … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. 
Suppose there was a bowl of water that was cloudy, murky, and muddy, hidden in the darkness. 
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it.

This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why sometimes even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. 
And this is why sometimes even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced.” 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

20. Brahmins )With Kāraṇapālī ^n194 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Now at that time the brahmin Kāraṇapālī was working for the Licchavis. 
He saw the brahmin Piṅgiyānī coming off in the distance 
and said to him, 
“So, Piṅgiyānī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 
“I’m coming, my good man, from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.” 
“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?” 
“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? 
You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.” 
“Master Piṅgiyānī praises the ascetic Gotama with magnificent praise indeed.” 
“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama? 
He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.” 
“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?” 
“Suppose a person was completely satisfied by the best tasting food. They wouldn’t be attracted to anything that tasted inferior. 
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then you’re not attracted to the doctrines of the various ascetics and brahmins. 
Suppose a person who was weak with hunger was to obtain a honey-cake. 
Wherever they taste it, they would enjoy a sweet, delicious flavor. 
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then you get a sense of uplift, a confidence of the heart. 
Suppose a person were to obtain a piece of sandalwood, 
whether yellow or red. 
Wherever they smelled it—
whether at the root, the middle, or the top—
they’d enjoy a delicious fragrance. 
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then you become filled with joy and happiness. 
Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
A good doctor would cure them on the spot. 
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then you make an end of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. 
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. 
They’d plunge into the lotus pond to bathe and drink. And all their stress, weariness, and heat exhaustion would die down. 
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then all your stress, weariness, and exhaustion die down.” 
When this was said, the brahmin Kāraṇapālī got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: 
“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
Excellent, Master Piṅgiyānī! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Piṅgiyānī has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Piṅgiyānī remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

20. Brahmins )Piṅgiyānī ^n195 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were visiting the Buddha. 
Some of the Licchavis were in blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue. And some were similarly colored in yellow, red, or white. 
But the Buddha outshone them all in beauty and glory. 
Then the brahmin Piṅgīyānī got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
So the brahmin Piṅgīyānī extolled the Buddha in his presence with a fitting verse. 
“Like a fragrant pink lotus 
that blooms in the morning, its fragrance unfaded—
see Aṅgīrasa shine, 
bright as the sun in the sky!” 
Then those Licchavis clothed Piṅgiyānī with five hundred upper robes. 
And Piṅgiyānī clothed the Buddha with them. 
Then the Buddha said to the Licchavis: 
“Licchavis, the appearance of five treasures is rare in the world. 
What five? 
A Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. 
A person who explains the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One. 
A person who understands the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One.
