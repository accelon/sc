^ck#a2(Book of Two)^ckan#a2a(The Chapter on Punishments )1. Faults ^bk#an2^n1 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants!” 
“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“There are, mendicants, these two faults. 
What two? 
The fault apparent in the present life, and the fault to do with lives to come. 
What is the fault apparent in the present life? 
It’s when someone sees that kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—
whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘grass blades’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded. 
It occurs to them: 
‘If I were to commit the kinds of bad deeds for which the kings arrested that bandit, that criminal, 

the rulers would arrest me and subject me to the same punishments. 

Afraid of the fault apparent in the present life, they do not steal the belongings of others. 
This is called the fault apparent in the present life. 
What is the fault to do with lives to come? 
It’s when someone reflects: 
‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in the next life. 
If I conduct myself badly, 
then, when my body breaks up, after death, won’t I be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?’ 
Afraid of the fault to do with lives to come, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. 
This is called the fault to do with lives to come. 
These are the two faults. 
So you should train like this: 
‘We will fear the fault apparent in the present life, and we will fear the fault to do with lives to come. We will fear faults, seeing the danger in faults.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
If you fear faults, seeing the danger in faults, you can expect to be freed from all faults.” 

2. Endeavor ^n2.1 “These two endeavors are challenging in the world. 
What two? 
The endeavor of laypeople staying in a home to provide robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And the endeavor of those gone forth from the lay life to homelessness to let go of all attachments. 
These are the two endeavors that are challenging in the world. 
The better of these two endeavors is the effort to let go of all attachments. 
So you should train like this: 
‘We shall endeavor to let go of all attachments.’ 
That’s how you should train.” 

3. Mortifying ^n3 “These two things, mendicants, are mortifying. 
What two? 
It’s when someone has done bad things and not done good things, by way of body, speech, and mind. 


Thinking, ‘I’ve done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re mortified. Thinking, ‘I haven’t done good things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re mortified. 


These are the two things that are mortifying.” 

4. Not Mortifying ^n4 “These two things, mendicants, are not mortifying. 
What two? 
It’s when someone has done good things and not done bad things, by way of body, speech, and mind. 


Thinking, ‘I’ve done good things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re not mortified. Thinking, ‘I haven’t done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re not mortified. 


These are the two things that are not mortifying.” 

5. Learned for Myself ^n5 “Mendicants, I have learned these two things for myself—
to never be content with skillful qualities, and to never stop trying. 
I never stopped trying, thinking: 
‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’ 
It was by diligence that I achieved awakening, and by diligence that I achieved the supreme sanctuary. 
If you too never stop trying, thinking: 
‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’ 
You will soon realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
So you should train like this: 
‘We will never stop trying, thinking: 
“Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.”’ 
That’s how you should train.” 

6. Fetters ^n6 “There are, mendicants, these two things. 
What two? 
Seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, and seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring. 
When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, you don’t give up greed, hate, and delusion. 
When these are not given up, you’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
You’re not freed from suffering, I say. 
When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring, you give up greed, hate, and delusion. 
When these are given up, you’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
You’re freed from suffering, I say. 
These are the two things.” 

7. Dark ^n7.1 “These two things, mendicants, are dark. 
What two? 
Lack of conscience and prudence. 
These are the two things that are dark.” 

8. Bright ^n8.1 “These two things, mendicants, are bright. 
What two? 
Conscience and prudence. 
These are the two things that are bright.” 

9. Conduct ^n9.1 “These two bright things, mendicants, protect the world. 
What two? 
Conscience and prudence. 
If these two bright things did not protect the world, there would be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of teachers and respected people. 
The world would become dissolute, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals. 
But because the two bright things protect the world, there is recognition of the status of mother, aunts, and wives and partners of teachers and respected people.” 

10. Entering the Rainy Season ^n10 “There are, mendicants, these two entries to the rainy season. 
What two? 
Earlier and later. 
These are the two entries to the rainy season.” 







The Chapter on Disciplinary Issues )11 ^n11.1 “There are, mendicants, these two powers. 
What two? 
The power of reflection and the power of development. 
And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection? 
It’s when someone reflects: 
‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’ 
Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. 
This is called the power of reflection. 
And what, mendicants, is the power of development? 
In this context, the power of development is the power of the trainees. 
For when you rely on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate, and delusion. 
Then you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad. 
This is called the power of development. 
These are the two powers.” 
12 ^n12 “There are, mendicants, these two powers. 
What two? 
The power of reflection and the power of development. 
And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection? 
It’s when someone reflects: 
‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’ 
Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. 
This is called the power of reflection. 
And what, mendicants, is the power of development? 
It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, 
investigation of principles, 
energy, 
rapture, 
tranquility, 
immersion, 
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
This is called the power of development. 
These are the two powers.” 
13 ^n13.1 “There are, mendicants, these two powers. 
What two? 
The power of reflection and the power of development. 
And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection? 
It’s when someone reflects: 
‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’ 
Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. 
This is called the power of reflection. 
And what, mendicants, is the power of development? 
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
This is called the power of development. 
These are the two powers.” 
14 ^n14.1 “There are, mendicants, these two ways of teaching the Dhamma. 
What two? 
In brief and in detail. 
These are two ways of teaching the Dhamma.” 
15 ^n15 “Mendicants, in a disciplinary issue, if neither the offending mendicant nor the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves, you can expect that issue 
will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants won’t live comfortably. 
But in a disciplinary issue, if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully check themselves, you can expect that issue 
won’t lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live comfortably. 
And how, mendicants, does an offending mendicant carefully check themselves? 
An offending mendicant reflects: 
‘I have committed a certain unskillful offense with the body. 
That mendicant saw me do this. 
If I hadn’t committed that offense, they wouldn’t have seen me. 
But since I did commit that offense, they did see me. 
When they saw me, they were upset, 
and they voiced their unhappiness to me. 
Then I also got upset, 
so I told others. 
So the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty on their goods.’ 
That’s how, mendicants, an offending mendicant carefully checks themselves. 
And how, mendicants, does an accusing mendicant carefully check themselves? 
An accusing mendicant reflects: 
‘This mendicant has committed a certain unskillful offense with the body. 
I saw them do that. 
If they hadn’t committed that offense, I wouldn’t have seen them. 
But since they did commit that offense, I did see them. 
When I saw them, I was upset, 
and I voiced my unhappiness to them. 
Then they also got upset, 
so they told others. 
So the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty on their goods.’ 
That’s how, mendicants, an accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves. 
In a disciplinary issue, if neither the offending mendicant nor the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves, you can expect that issue will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants won’t live comfortably. 
But in a disciplinary issue, if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves, you can expect that issue won’t lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live comfortably.” 
16 ^n16.1 Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?” 
“Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.” 
“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?” 
“Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he was righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
17 ^n17 Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?” 
“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done. 
That’s why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.” 
“But what is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?” 
“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done. 
That’s why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” 
“I don’t understand the meaning of what Master Gotama has said in brief, without explaining the details. 
Master Gotama, please teach me this matter in detail so I can understand the meaning.” 
“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes sir,” Jāṇussoṇi replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Firstly, brahmin, someone has done bad things and not done good things by way of body, speech, and mind. 


So what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
Furthermore, brahmin, someone has done good things and not done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. 


So what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
18 ^n18.1 Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
“Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should not do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.” 
“But, sir, if someone does these things that should not be done, what drawbacks should they expect?” 
“They should expect these drawbacks. 
They blame themselves. 
After examination, sensible people criticize them. 
They get a bad reputation. 
They feel lost when they die. 
And when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
These are the drawbacks they should expect.” 
“Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.” 
“But, sir, if someone does these things that should be done, what benefits should they expect?” 
“They should expect these benefits. 
They don’t blame themselves. 
After examination, sensible people praise them. 
They get a good reputation. 
They don’t feel lost when they die. 
And when the body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
These are the benefits they should expect.” 
19 ^n19.1 “Mendicants, give up the unskillful. 
It is possible to give up the unskillful. 
If it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say: 
‘Give up the unskillful.’ 
But it is possible, and so I say: 
‘Give up the unskillful.’ 
And if giving up the unskillful led to harm and suffering, I would not say: 
‘Give up the unskillful.’ 
But giving up the unskillful leads to welfare and happiness, so I say: 
‘Give up the unskillful.’ 
Mendicants, develop the skillful. 
It is possible to develop the skillful. 
If it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say: 
‘Develop the skillful.’ 
But it is possible, and so I say: 
‘Develop the skillful.’ 
If developing the skillful led to harm and suffering I wouldn’t say: 
‘Develop the skillful.’ 
But developing the skillful leads to welfare and happiness, so I say: 
‘Develop the skillful.’” 
20 ^n20 “These two things, mendicants, lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 
What two? 
The words and phrases are misplaced, and the meaning is misinterpreted. 
When the words and phrases are misplaced, the meaning is misinterpreted. 
These two things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 
^n21 These two things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. 
What two? 
The words and phrases are well organized, and the meaning is correctly interpreted. 
When the words and phrases are well organized, the meaning is correctly interpreted. 
These two things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.” 

The Chapter on Fools )21 ^n22.1 “Mendicants, there are two fools. 
What two? 
One who doesn’t recognize when they’ve made a mistake. And one who doesn’t properly accept the confession of someone who’s made a mistake. 
These are the two fools. 
There are two who are astute. 
What two? 
One who recognizes when they’ve made a mistake. And one who properly accepts the confession of someone who’s made a mistake. 
These are the two who are astute.” 
22 ^n23.1 “Mendicants, these two misrepresent the Realized One. 
What two? 
One who is hateful and hides it, and one whose faith is mistaken. 
These two misrepresent the Realized One.” 
23 ^n24 “Mendicants, these two misrepresent the Realized One. 
What two? 
One who explains what was not spoken by the Realized One as spoken by him. And one who explains what was spoken by the Realized One as not spoken by him. 
These two misrepresent the Realized One. 
These two don’t misrepresent the Realized One. 
What two? 
One who explains what was not spoken by the Realized One as not spoken by him. And one who explains what was spoken by the Realized One as spoken by him. 
These two don’t misrepresent the Realized One.” 
24 ^n25.1 “Mendicants, these two misrepresent the Realized One. 
What two? 
One who explains a discourse in need of interpretation as a discourse whose meaning is explicit. And one who explains a discourse whose meaning is explicit as a discourse in need of interpretation. 
These two misrepresent the Realized One.” 
25 ^n26 “These two don’t misrepresent the Realized One. 
What two? 
One who explains a discourse in need of interpretation as a discourse in need of interpretation. And one who explains a discourse whose meaning is explicit as a discourse whose meaning is explicit. 
These two don’t misrepresent the Realized One.” 
26 ^n27.1 “Mendicants, when you hide your misdeeds, you can expect one of two destinies: 
hell or the animal realm. 
When you don’t hide your misdeeds, you can expect one of two destinies: 
as a god or a human.” 
27 ^n28.1 “Mendicants, when you have wrong view, you can expect one of two destinies: 
hell or the animal realm.” 
28 ^n29.1 “Mendicants, when you have right view, you can expect one of two destinies: 
as a god or a human.” 
29 ^n30.1 “There are two places waiting to receive an unethical person: 
hell and the animal realm. 
There are two places waiting to receive an ethical person: 
the realms of gods and humans.” 
30 ^n31 “Mendicants, I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. 
What two? 
Seeing a happy life for oneself in the present, and having compassion for future generations. 
I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.” 
31 ^n32.1 “These two things play a part in realization. 
What two? 
Serenity and discernment. 
What is the benefit of developing serenity? 
The mind is developed. 
What is the benefit of developing the mind? 
Greed is given up. 
What is the benefit of developing discernment? 
Wisdom is developed. 
What is the benefit of developing wisdom? 
Ignorance is given up. 
The mind contaminated by greed is not free; and wisdom contaminated by ignorance does not grow. 
In this way, freedom of heart comes from the fading away of greed, while freedom by wisdom comes from the fading away of ignorance.” 

^ckan#a2d(The Chapter on the Peaceful Mind )32 ^n33 “Mendicants, I will teach you the level of the bad person and the level of the good person. 
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“What is the level of the bad person? 
The bad person is ungrateful and thankless, 
for the wicked only know how to be ungrateful and thankless. 
It is totally the level of a bad person to be ungrateful and thankless. 
The good person is grateful and thankful, 
for the virtuous only know how to be grateful and thankful. 
It is totally the level of a good person to be grateful and thankful.” 
33 ^n34 “Mendicants, I say that these two people cannot easily be repaid. 
What two? 
Mother and father. 
You would not have done enough to repay your mother and father even if you were to carry your mother around on one shoulder and your father on the other, and if you lived like this for a hundred years, and if you were to anoint, massage, bathe, and rub them; 
and even if they were to defecate and urinate right there. 
Even if you were to establish your mother and father as supreme monarchs of this great earth, abounding in the seven treasures, you would still not have done enough to repay them. 
Why is that? 
Parents are very helpful to their children: they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world. 
But you have done enough, more than enough, to repay them if you encourage, settle, and ground unfaithful parents in faith, unethical parents in ethical conduct, stingy parents in generosity, or ignorant parents in wisdom.” 
34 ^n35 Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, 
“What does Master Gotama teach? What does he explain?” 
“Brahmin, I teach action and inaction.” 
“But in what way does Master Gotama teach action and inaction?” 
“I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things. 
I teach action regarding good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of skillful things. 
This is the kind of action and inaction that I teach.” 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
35 ^n36 Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha, 
“How many kinds of people in the world are worthy of a religious donation? And where should a gift be given?” 
“Householder, there are two kinds of people in the world who are worthy of a religious donation: 
the trainee and the master. 
These are two kinds of people in the world who are worthy of a religious donation, and that’s where you should give a gift.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
“In this world, the trainee and the master, 
are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods. 
They are upright in body, 
speech, and mind. 
This is the field for sponsors of sacrifice—
what’s given here is very fruitful.” 
36 ^n37 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, mendicants!” 
“Reverend,” they replied. 
Sāriputta said this: 
“I will teach you about a person fettered internally and one fettered externally. 
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, reverend,” they replied. 
Sāriputta said this: 
“Who is a person fettered internally? 
It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods. 
When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this state of existence. 
This is called a person who is fettered internally, a returner, who comes back to this state of existence. 
Who is a person fettered externally? 
It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
They enter and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mind. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods. 
When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not coming back to this state of existence. 
This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this state of existence. 
Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical … they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures. 
They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives. 
They practice for the ending of craving. 
They practice for the ending of greed. 
When their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in one of the orders of gods. 
When they pass away from there, they are non-returners, not coming back to this state of existence. 
This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this state of existence.” 
Then several peaceful-minded deities went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters. 
The assembly is overjoyed! 
Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.” 
The Buddha consented with silence. 
Then the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, in front of Sāriputta. 
He sat on the seat spread out. 
Sāriputta bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. 
The Buddha said to him: 
“Just now, Sāriputta, several peaceful-minded deities came up to me, bowed, and stood to one side. Those deities said to me: 
‘Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters. 
The assembly is overjoyed! 
Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.’ 
Those deities, though they number ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other. 
Sāriputta, you might think: 
‘Surely those deities, since so many of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other, must have developed their minds in that place.’ 
But you should not see it like this. 
It was right here that those deities developed their minds. 
So you should train like this: 
‘We shall have peaceful faculties and peaceful minds.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
When your faculties and mind are peaceful, your acts of body, speech, and mind will be peaceful, thinking: 
‘We shall present the gift of peace to our spiritual companions.’ 
That’s how you should train. 
Those wanderers of other religions, Sāriputta, who have not heard this exposition of the teaching are lost.” 
37 ^n38 So I have heard. 
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying at Varaṇā, on the bank of the Kaddama Lake. 
Then the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa went up to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna: 
“What is the cause, Master Kaccāna, what is the reason why aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders?” 
“It is because of their insistence on sensual desire, their shackles, avarice, and attachment, that aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders.” 
“What is the cause, Master Kaccāna, what is the reason why ascetics fight with ascetics?” 
“It is because of their insistence on views, their shackles, avarice, and attachment, that ascetics fight with ascetics.” 
“Master Kaccāna, is there anyone in the world who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?” 
“There is, brahmin.” 
“Who in the world has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?” 
“In the eastern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī. 
There the Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
He, brahmin, has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views.” 
When this was said, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: 
“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
He who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views. 
Excellent, Master Kaccāna! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
38 ^n39.1 At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove. 
Then the brahmin Kandarāyana went up to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him … He sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna: 
“I have heard, Master Kaccāna, that the ascetic Kaccāna doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. 
And this is indeed the case, 
for the ascetic Kaccāna does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. 
This is not appropriate, Master Kaccāna.” 
“There is the stage of an elder and the stage of youth as explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
If an elder, though eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, still dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more, 
they are reckoned as a child, not a senior. 
If a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, 
does not dwell in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more, 
they are reckoned as astute, a senior.” 
When this was said, the brahmin Kandarāyana got up from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, and bowed with his head at the feet of the young mendicants, saying, 
“The masters are elders, at the stage of the elder; 
we are youths, at the stage of youth. 
Excellent, Master Kaccāna! … From this day forth, may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
39 ^n40.1 “At a time when bandits are strong, kings are weak. 
Then the king is not at ease when going out or coming back or when touring the provinces. 
The brahmins and householders, likewise, are not at ease when going out or coming back, or when inspecting their business activities. 
In the same way, at a time when bad mendicants are strong, good-hearted mendicants are weak. 
Then the good-hearted mendicants continually adhere to silence in the midst of the Saṅgha, or they stay in the borderlands. 
This is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of many people, of gods and humans.

Because of wrong practice, neither laypeople nor renunciates succeed in completing the system of the skillful teaching. 
I praise right practice for these two, for laypeople and renunciates. 
Because of right practice, both laypeople and renunciates succeed in completing the system of the skillful teaching.” 
41 ^n42.1 “Mendicants, by memorizing the discourses incorrectly, taking only a semblance of the phrasing, some mendicants shut out the meaning and the teaching. They act for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of many people, of gods and humans. 
They make much bad karma and make the true teaching disappear. 
But by memorizing the discourses well, not taking only a semblance of the phrasing, some mendicants reinforce the meaning and the teaching. They act for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the people, of gods and humans. 
They make much merit and make the true teaching continue.”

It’s when a senior mendicant thinks: 
‘No mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior, should admonish me; 
and I shouldn’t admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior. 
If a mendicant—whether senior, middle, or junior—were to admonish me, they wouldn’t be sympathetic, and I’d bother them by saying “No!” And anyway I wouldn’t deal with it even if I saw what I did wrong.’
