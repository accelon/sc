^ak#dn(Long Discourses) ^bk#dn1(Long Discourse1) ^ck#d1(The Prime Net )1. Talk on Wanderers ^n1 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants. 
The wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road, together with his pupil, the brahmin student Brahmadatta. 
Meanwhile, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, 
but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. 
And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other. 
^n2 Then the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. 
And Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewise. 
There too, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, 
but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. 
And so both teacher and pupil kept on directly contradicting each other. 
^n3 Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of evaluation came up:
“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing how the diverse attitudes of sentient beings have been clearly comprehended by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
For this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, 
while his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many ways. 
And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.” 
^n4 When the Buddha found out about this discussion on evaluation among the mendicants, he went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, 
“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” 
The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, 
 
 
 
 
 
“This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” 
^n5 “Mendicants, if others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and exasperated.
You’ll get angry and upset, which would be an obstacle for you alone. 
If others were to criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, and you got angry and upset, would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorly?” 
“No, sir.” 
“If others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should explain that what is untrue is in fact untrue: 
‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false. There’s no such thing in us, it’s not found among us.’ 
^n6 If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and excited. 
You’ll get thrilled, elated, and excited, which would be an obstacle for you alone. 
If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should acknowledge that what is true is in fact true: 
‘This is why that’s true, this is why that’s correct. There is such a thing in us, it is found among us.’ 
2. Ethics 2.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics ^n7 When an ordinary person speaks praise of the Realized One, they speak only of trivial, insignificant details of mere ethics.

I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”

The longer section on ethics is finished. 
3. Views 3.1. Theories About the Past ^n28 There are other principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. Those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
And what are these principles? 
^n29 There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and assert various hypotheses concerning the past on eighteen grounds. 
And what are the eighteen grounds on which they rely? 
3.1.1. Eternalism ^n30 There are some ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds. 
And what are the four grounds on which they rely? 
^n31 It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. 
That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the cosmos contracting, many eons of the cosmos expanding, many eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
They say: 
‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I recollect my many kinds of past lives, 
with features and details. 
Because of this I know: 
“The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’ 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
^n32 And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. 
That is: one eon of the cosmos contracting and expanding; two, three, four, five, or ten eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
They say:

with features and details. 
Because of this I know: 
“The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.”’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
^n33 And what is the third ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. 
That is: ten eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding; twenty, thirty, or forty eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
They say: 
‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I recollect my many kinds of past lives,

Because of this I know: 
“The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.”’ 
This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
^n34 And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: 
‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’ 
This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
^n35 These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none.
^n36 The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
^n37 These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
 
3.1.2. Partial Eternalism ^n38 There are some ascetics and brahmins who are partial eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal on four grounds. 
And what are the four grounds on which they rely? 
^n39 There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts. 
As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance. 
There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. 
^n40 There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands. 
As it expands an empty mansion of Brahmā appears. 
Then a certain sentient being—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—passes away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā. 
There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. 
^n41 But after staying there all alone for a long time, they become dissatisfied and anxious: 
‘Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.’ 
Then other sentient beings—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—pass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā in company with that being. 
There they too are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. 
^n42 Now, the being who was reborn there first thinks: 
‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. 
These beings were created by me! 
Why is that? 
Because first I thought: 
“Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.” 
Such was my heart’s wish, and then these creatures came to this state of existence.’
And the beings who were reborn there later also think: 
‘This must be Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. 
And we have been created by him. 
Why is that? 
Because we see that he was reborn here first, and we arrived later.’ 
^n43 And the being who was reborn first is more long-lived, beautiful, and illustrious than those who arrived later. 
 
^n44 It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. 
Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. 
They say: 
‘He who is Brahmā—the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born—is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. 
We who were created by that Brahmā are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence. 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. 
^n45 And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
There are gods named ‘depraved by play.’ They spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. And in doing so, they lose their mindfulness, and they pass away from that host of gods. 
^n46 It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. 
Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. 
They say: 
‘The gods not depraved by play don’t spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. So they don’t lose their mindfulness, and don’t pass away from that host of gods. 
They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. 
But we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. In doing so, we lost our mindfulness, and passed away from that host of gods. 
We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. 
^n47 And what is the third ground on which they rely? 
There are gods named ‘malevolent’. They spend too much time gazing at each other, so they grow angry with each other, and their bodies and minds get tired. They pass away from that host of gods.
^n48 It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. 
Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. 
They say: 
‘The gods who are not malevolent don’t spend too much time gazing at each other, so they don’t grow angry with each other, their bodies and minds don’t get tired, and they don’t pass away from that host of gods. 
They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. 
But we who were malevolent spent too much time gazing at each other, we grew angry with each other, our bodies and minds got tired, and we passed away from that host of gods. 
We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.’ 
This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. 
^n49 And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: 
‘That which is called “the eye” or “the ear” or “the nose” or “the tongue” or “the body”: that self is impermanent, not lasting, transient, perishable. 
That which is called “mind” or “sentience” or “consciousness”: that self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity.’ 
This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. 
^n50 These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
^n51 The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
^n52 These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.1.3. The Cosmos is Finite or Infinite ^n53 There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about size, and assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite on four grounds. 
And what are the four grounds on which they rely? 
^n54 It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite. 
They say: 
‘The cosmos is finite and bounded. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite. 
Because of this I know: 
“The cosmos is finite and bounded.”’ 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
^n55 And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as infinite. 
They say: 
‘The cosmos is infinite and unbounded. 
The ascetics and brahmins who say that 
the cosmos is finite are wrong. 
The cosmos is infinite and unbounded. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I meditate perceiving the cosmos as infinite. 
Because of this I know: 
“The cosmos is infinite and unbounded.”’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
^n56 And what is the third ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite vertically but infinite horizontally. 
They say: 
‘The cosmos is both finite and infinite. 
The ascetics and brahmins who say that 
the cosmos is finite are wrong, 
and so are those who say that 
the cosmos is infinite. 
The cosmos is both finite and infinite. 
Why is that? 
Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite vertically but infinite horizontally. 
Because of this I know: 
“The cosmos is both finite and infinite.”’ 
This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
^n57 And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: 
‘The cosmos is neither finite nor infinite. 
The ascetics and brahmins who say that 
the cosmos is finite are wrong, 
as are those who say that 
the cosmos is infinite, 
and also those who say that 
the cosmos is both finite and infinite. 
The cosmos is neither finite nor infinite.’ 
This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
^n58 These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
^n59 The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
^n60 These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.1.4. Equivocators ^n61 There are some ascetics and brahmins who are equivocators. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation on four grounds. 
And what are the four grounds on which they rely? 
^n62 It’s when some ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
They think: 
‘I don’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
If I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful I might be wrong. 
That would be stressful for me, 
and that stress would be an obstacle.’ 
So from fear and disgust with false speech they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: 
‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocation. 
^n63 And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
They think: 
‘I don’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
If I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful I might feel desire or greed or hate or repulsion. 
That would be grasping on my part. 
That would be stressful for me, 
and that stress would be an obstacle.’ 
So from fear and disgust with grasping they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: 
‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocation. 
^n64 And what is the third ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
They think: 
‘I don’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
Suppose I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful. 
There are clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. 
They might pursue, press, and grill me about that. 
I’d be stumped by such a grilling. 
That would be stressful for me, 
and that stress would be an obstacle.’ 
So from fear and disgust with examination they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: 
‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocation. 
^n65 And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin is dull and stupid. 
Because of that, whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: 
‘Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world. If I believed there was, I would say so. 
But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so. 
Suppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world … 
whether there both is and is not another world … 
whether there neither is nor is not another world … 
whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether a Realized One exists after death … 
whether a Realized One doesn’t exist after death … 
whether a Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death … 
whether a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. If I believed there was, I would say so. 
But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocation. 
^n66 These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who are equivocators resort to evasiveness and equivocation whenever they’re asked a question. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who resort to equivocation do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.1.5. Doctrines of Origination by Chance ^n67 There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance. They assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds. 
And what are the two grounds on which they rely? 
^n68 There are gods named ‘non-percipient beings’. 
When perception arises they pass away from that host of gods. 
It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. 
Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect the arising of perception, but no further. 
They say: 
‘The self and the cosmos arose by chance. 
Why is that? 
Because formerly I didn’t exist. Now, having not been, I’ve sprung into existence.’ 
This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. 
^n69 And what is the second ground on which they rely? 
It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. 
They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: 
‘The self and the cosmos arose by chance.’ 
This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. 
^n70 These are the two grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance do so on one or other of these two grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
^n71 These are the eighteen grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past assert various hypotheses concerning the past. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past do so on one or other of these eighteen grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
^n72 The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
^n73 These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
 
3.2. Theories About the Future ^n74 There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future, and assert various hypotheses concerning the future on forty-four grounds. 
And what are the forty-four grounds on which they rely? 
3.2.1. Percipient Life After Death ^n75 There are some ascetics and brahmins who say there is life after death, and assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds. 
And what are the sixteen grounds on which they rely? 
^n76 They assert: ‘The self is sound and percipient after death, and it is physical … 
non-physical … 
both physical and non-physical … 
neither physical nor non-physical … 
finite … 
infinite … 
both finite and infinite … 
neither finite nor infinite … 
of unified perception … 
of diverse perception … 
of limited perception … 
of limitless perception … 
experiences nothing but happiness … 
experiences nothing but suffering … 
experiences both happiness and suffering … 
experiences neither happiness nor suffering.’ 
^n77 These are the sixteen grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form do so on one or other of these sixteen grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.2.2. Non-Percipient Life After Death ^n78 There are some ascetics and brahmins who say there is life after death, and assert that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form on eight grounds. 
And what are the eight grounds on which they rely? 
^n79 They assert: ‘The self is sound and non-percipient after death, and it is physical … 
non-physical … 
both physical and non-physical … 
neither physical nor non-physical … 
finite … 
infinite … 
both finite and infinite … 
neither finite nor infinite.’ 
^n80 These are the eight grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form do so on one or other of these eight grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.2.3. Neither Percipient Nor Non-Percipient Life After Death ^n81 There are some ascetics and brahmins who say there is life after death, and assert that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds. 
And what are the eight grounds on which they rely? 
^n82 They assert: ‘The self is sound and neither percipient nor non-percipient after death, and it is physical … 
non-physical … 
both physical and non-physical … 
neither physical nor non-physical … 
finite … 
infinite … 
both finite and infinite … 
neither finite nor infinite.’ 
^n83 These are the eight grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form do so on one or other of these eight grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.2.4. Annihilationism ^n84 There are some ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists. They assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being on seven grounds. 
And what are the seven grounds on which they rely? 
^n85 There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: 
‘This self is physical, made up of the four primary elements, and produced by mother and father. Since it’s annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
^n86 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self that is divine, physical, sensual, consuming solid food. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
^n87 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self that is divine, physical, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
^n88 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self which has gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that “space is infinite”, it’s reborn in the dimension of infinite space. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
^n89 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self which has gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that “consciousness is infinite”, it’s reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
^n90 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self that has gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that “there is nothing at all”, it’s been reborn in the dimension of nothingness. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
^n91 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated. 
There is another self that has gone totally beyond the dimension of nothingness. Aware that “this is peaceful, this is sublime”, it’s been reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. 
You don’t know or see that. 
But I know it and see it. 
Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’ 
That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. 
^n92 These are the seven grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being do so on one or other of these seven grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
3.2.5. Extinguishment in the Present Life ^n93 There are some ascetics and brahmins who speak of extinguishment in the present life. They assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds. 
And what are the five grounds on which they rely? 
^n94 There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: 
‘When this self amuses itself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, that’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
^n95 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. 
Why is that? 
Because sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Their decay and perishing give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, this self enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
^n96 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. 
Why is that? 
Because the placing of the mind and the keeping it connected there are coarse. 
But when the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, this self enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
^n97 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. 
Why is that? 
Because the rapture and emotional excitement there are coarse. 
But with the fading away of rapture, this self enters and remains in the third absorption, where it meditates with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss”. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
^n98 But someone else says to them: 
‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. 
But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. 
Why is that? 
Because the bliss and enjoyment there are coarse. 
But giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, this self enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ 
That is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
^n99 These are the five grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life do so on one or other of these five grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
^n100 These are the forty-four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future assert various hypotheses concerning the future. 
Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future do so on one or other of these forty-four grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
The Realized One understands this … 
And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
^n101 These are the sixty-two grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past and the future assert various hypotheses concerning the past and the future. 
^n102 Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future do so on one or other of these sixty-two grounds. Outside of this there is none. 
^n103 The Realized One understands this: 
‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ 
He understands this, and what goes beyond this. Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. 
Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. 
^n104 These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. 
4. The Grounds For Assertions About the Self and the Cosmos 4.1. Anxiety and Evasiveness ^n105 Now, these things are only the feeling of those who do not know or see, the agitation and evasiveness of those under the sway of craving. Namely, when those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds … 
^n106 partially eternal on four grounds … 
^n107 finite or infinite on four grounds … 
^n108 or they resort to equivocation on four grounds … 
^n109 or they assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds … 
^n110 they theorize about the past on these eighteen grounds … 
^n111 or they assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds … 
^n112 or that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form on eight grounds … 
^n113 or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds … 
^n114 or they assert the annihilation of an existing being on seven grounds … 
^n115 or they assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds … 
^n116 they theorize about the future on these forty-four grounds … 
^n117 When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, these things are only the feeling of those who do not know or see, the agitation and evasiveness of those under the sway of craving. 
4.2. Conditioned by Contact ^n118 Now, these things are conditioned by contact. Namely, when those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds … 
^n119 partially eternal on four grounds … 
^n120 finite or infinite on four grounds … 
^n121 or they resort to equivocation on four grounds … 
^n122 or they assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds … 
^n123 they theorize about the past on these eighteen grounds … 
^n124 or they assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds … 
^n125 or that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form on eight grounds … 
^n126 or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds … 
^n127 or they assert the annihilation of an existing being on seven grounds … 
^n128 or they assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds … 
^n129 they theorize about the future on these forty-four grounds … 
^n130 When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, that too is conditioned by contact. 
4.3. Not Possible ^n131  
^n132  
^n133  
^n134  
^n135  
^n136  
^n137  
^n138  
^n139  
^n140  
^n141  
^n142  
^n143 Now, when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, it is not possible that they should experience these things without contact. 
4.4. Dependent Origination ^n144  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now, when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, all of them experience this by repeated contact through the six fields of contact. Their feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. 
5. The End of the Round ^n145 When a mendicant truly understands the six fields of contacts’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape, they understand what lies beyond all these things. 
^n146 All of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixty-two grounds, so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net. 
Suppose a deft fisherman or his apprentice were to cast a fine-meshed net over a small pond. They’d think: ‘Any sizable creatures in this pond will be trapped in the net. Wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net.’ 
In the same way, all of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixty-two grounds, so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net. 
^n147 The Realized One’s body remains, but his attachment to rebirth has been cut off. 
As long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humans. 
But when his body breaks up, after life has ended, gods and humans will see him no more. 
When the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut, all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow along. 
In the same way, the Realized One’s body remains, but his attachment to rebirth has been cut off. 
As long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humans. 
But when his body breaks up, after life has ended, gods and humans will see him no more.” 
^n148 When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” 
“Well, then, Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Net of Meaning’, or else ‘The Net of the Teaching’, or else ‘The Prime Net’, or else ‘The Net of Views’, or else ‘The Supreme Victory in Battle’.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
^n149 Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. 
And while this discourse was being spoken, the galaxy shook. 

^ck#d2(The Fruits of the Ascetic Life )1. A Discussion With the King’s Ministers ^n150 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. 
Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudi full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha was sitting upstairs in the stilt longhouse surrounded by his ministers. 
Then Ajātasattu expressed this heartfelt sentiment, 
“Oh, sirs, this moonlit night is so very delightful, so beautiful, so glorious, so lovely, so striking.
Now, what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today, paying homage to whom my mind might find peace?”
^n151 When he had spoken, one of the king’s ministers said to him, 
“Sire, Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. 
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. 
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” 
But when he had spoken, the king remained silent. 
^n152 Another of the king’s ministers said to him, 
“Sire, Makkhali Gosāla leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. 
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. 
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” 
But when he had spoken, the king remained silent. 
^n153 Another of the king’s ministers said to him, 
“Sire, Ajita Kesakambala leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. 
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. 
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” 
But when he had spoken, the king remained silent. 
^n154 Another of the king’s ministers said to him, 
“Sire, Pakudha Kaccāyana leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. 
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. 
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” 
But when he had spoken, the king remained silent. 
^n155 Another of the king’s ministers said to him, 
“Sire, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. 
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. 
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” 
But when he had spoken, the king remained silent. 
^n156 Another of the king’s ministers said to him, 
“Sire, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. 
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. 
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” 
But when he had spoken, the king remained silent. 
2. A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca ^n157 Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king. 
Then the king said to him, 
“But my dear Jīvaka, why are you silent?” 
“Sire, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. 
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” 
^n158 “Well then, my dear Jīvaka, have the elephants readied.” 
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Jīvaka. He had around five hundred female elephants readied, in addition to the king’s bull elephant for riding. Then he informed the king, 
“The elephants are ready, sire. 
Please go at your convenience.” 
^n159 Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants, while he mounted his bull elephant. With attendants carrying torches, he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvaka’s mango grove.
But as he drew near the mango grove, the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end. 
He said to Jīvaka, 
“My dear Jīvaka, I hope you’re not deceiving me! 
I hope you’re not betraying me! 
I hope you’re not turning me over to my enemies! 
For how on earth can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any noise in such a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants?” 
“Do not fear, great king, do not fear! 
I am not deceiving you, 
or betraying you, 
or turning you over to your enemies. 
Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps shining in the pavilion.” 
3. The Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic Life ^n160 Then King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the pavilion door on foot, where he asked Jīvaka, 
“But my dear Jīvaka, where is the Buddha?” 
“That is the Buddha, great king, that is the Buddha! 
He’s sitting against the central column facing east, in front of the Saṅgha of mendicants.” 
^n161 Then the king went up to the Buddha and stood to one side. 
He looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent, like a still, clear lake, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment, 
“May my son, Prince Udāyibhadda, be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!” 
“Has your mind gone to one you love, great king?” 
“I love my son, sir, Prince Udāyibhadda. 
May he be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!” 
^n162 Then the king bowed to the Buddha, raised his joined palms toward the Saṅgha, and sat down to one side. 
He said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, I’d like to ask you about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” 
 
“Ask what you wish, great king.” 
^n163 “Sir, there are many different professional fields.
These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants.
They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in the present life. 
With that they bring happiness and joy to themselves, their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. 
Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in the present life?” 
^n164 “Great king, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins?” 
“I do, sir.” 
“If you wouldn’t mind, great king, tell me how they answered.” 
“It’s no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting here.” 
“Well, speak then, great king.” 
3.1. The Doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa ^n165 “One time, sir, I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. 
 
 
 
 
^n166 He said to me: 
‘Great king, the one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. 
If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. 
If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit. 
In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’ 
And so, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of inaction. 
It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. 
 
I thought: 
‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ 
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa. 
I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.
3.2. The Doctrine of Makkhali Gosāla ^n167 One time, sir, I approached Makkhali Gosāla and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. 
 
 
^n168 He said: 
‘Great king, there is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings. Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or condition. 
There’s no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beings. 
Sentient beings are purified without cause or condition. 
One does not act of one’s own volition, one does not act of another’s volition, one does not act from a person’s volition. There is no power, no energy, no manly strength or vigor.
All sentient beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth. 
There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven winds, 700 winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering. 
And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little,” for that cannot be. 
Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. 
It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. 
In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’ 
^n169 And so, when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigration. 
It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. 
 
I thought: 
‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ 
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Makkhali Gosāla. 
I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. 
3.3. The Doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala ^n170 One time, sir, I approached Ajita Kesakambala and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. 
 
 
^n171 He said: 
‘Great king, there is no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight. 
This person is made up of the four primary elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space. 
Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. 
Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. 
The bones become bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. 
Giving is a doctrine of morons. 
When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just hollow, false nonsense. 
Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and don’t exist after death.’ 
^n172 And so, when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of annihilationism. 
It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. 
 
I thought: 
‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ 
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Ajita Kesakambala. 
I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. 
3.4. The Doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana ^n173 One time, sir, I approached Pakudha Kaccāyana and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. 
 
 
^n174 He said: 
‘Great king, these seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. 
What seven? 
The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. 
These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. 
And here there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others understand. 
If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. 
The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances.’ 
^n175 And so, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with something else entirely. 
It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. 
 
I thought: 
‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ 
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pakudha Kaccāyana. 
I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. 
3.5. The Doctrine of Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta ^n176 One time, sir, I approached Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. 
 
 
^n177 He said: 
‘Great king, consider a Jain ascetic who is restrained in the fourfold restraint. 
And how is a Jain ascetic restrained in the fourfold restraint? 
It’s when a Jain ascetic is obstructed by all water, devoted to all water, shaking off all water, pervaded by all water. 
That’s how a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restraint. 
When a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restraint, 
they’re called a knotless one who is self-realized, self-controlled, and steadfast.’ 
^n178 And so, when I asked Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the fourfold restraint. 
It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. 
 
I thought: 
‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ 
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. 
I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. 
3.6. The Doctrine of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta ^n179 One time, sir, I approached Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. 
 
 
^n180 He said: 
‘Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world. If I believed there was, I would say so. 
But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so. 
Suppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world … 
whether there both is and is not another world … 
whether there neither is nor is not another world … 
whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there are no beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … 
whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … 
whether a Realized One exists after death … 
whether a Realized One doesn’t exist after death … 
whether a Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death … 
whether a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. If I believed there was, I would say so. 
But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ 
^n181 And so, when I asked Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with evasiveness. 
It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. 
 
I thought: 
‘This is the most foolish and stupid of all these ascetics and brahmins! 
How on earth can he answer with evasiveness when asked about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life?’ 
I thought: 
‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ 
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta. 
I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. 
4. The Fruits of the Ascetic Life 4.1. The First Fruit of the Ascetic Life ^n182 And so I ask the Buddha: 
Sir, there are many different professional fields. 
These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants. 
They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in the present life. 
With that they bring happiness and joy to themselves, their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. 
Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in the present life?” 
^n183 “I can, great king. 
Well then, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. 
What do you think, great king? 
Suppose you had a person who was a bondservant, a worker. They get up before you and go to bed after you, and are obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at your face.
They’d think: 
‘The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible, so amazing! 
For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I. 
Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god. 
Whereas I’m his bondservant, his worker. I get up before him and go to bed after him, and am obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at his face. 
I should do good deeds. 
Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ 
After some time, that is what they do. 
Having gone forth they’d live restrained in body, speech, and mind, living content with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion. 
And suppose your men were to report all this to you. 
 
 
 
Would you say to them: 
‘Bring that person to me! Let them once more be my bondservant, my worker’?” 
^n184 “No, sir. 
Rather, I would bow to them, rise in their presence, and offer them a seat. I’d invite them to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d arrange for their lawful guarding and protection.” 
^n185 “What do you think, great king? 
If this is so, is there a fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life or not?” 
“Clearly, sir, there is.” 
“This is the first fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life, which I point out to you.” 
4.2. The Second Fruit of the Ascetic Life ^n186 “But sir, can you point out another fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in the present life?” 
“I can, great king. 
Well then, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. 
What do you think, great king?
Suppose you had a person who was a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital. 
They’d think: 
‘The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible, so amazing! 
For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I. 
Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god. 
Whereas I’m a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital. 
I should do good deeds. 
Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ 
After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They’d shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
Having gone forth they’d live restrained in body, speech, and mind, living content with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion. 
And suppose your men were to report all this to you. 
 
 
 
Would you say to them: 
‘Bring that person to me! Let them once more be a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital’?” 
^n187 “No, sir. 
Rather, I would bow to them, rise in their presence, and offer them a seat. I’d invite them to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d arrange for their lawful guarding and protection.” 
^n188 “What do you think, great king? 
If this is so, is there a fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life or not?” 
“Clearly, sir, there is.” 
“This is the second fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life, which I point out to you.” 
4.3. The Finer Fruits of the Ascetic Life ^n189 “But sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than these?” 
“I can, great king. 
Well then, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied the king. 
^n190 The Buddha said this: 
“Consider when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
^n191 A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some clan. 
They gain faith in the Realized One, 
and reflect: 
‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. 
It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. 
Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ 
^n192 After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
^n193 Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content. 
4.3.1. Ethics 4.3.1.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics ^n194 And how, great king, is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? 
It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
They refrain from injuring plants and seeds. 
They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. 
They avoid dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows. 
They refrain from beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. 
They avoid high and luxurious beds. 
They avoid receiving gold and money, 
raw grains, 
raw meat, 
women and girls, 
male and female bondservants, 
goats and sheep, 
chickens and pigs, 
elephants, cows, horses, and mares, 
and fields and land. 
They refrain from running errands and messages; 
buying and selling; 
falsifying weights, metals, or measures; 
bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; 
mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
The shorter section on ethics is finished. 
4.3.1.2. The Middle Section on Ethics ^n195 There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in injuring plants and seeds. 
These include plants propagated from roots, stems, cuttings, or joints; and those from regular seeds as the fifth. They refrain from such injury to plants and seeds. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
^n196 There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in storing up goods for their own use. 
This includes such things as food, drink, clothes, vehicles, bedding, fragrance, and material possessions. 
They refrain from storing up such goods. 
This pertains to their ethics. 
^n197 There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in seeing shows.

^n212 A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. 
It’s like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees no danger from his foes in any quarter. 
In the same way, a mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. 
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. 
The longer section on ethics is finished. 
4.3.2. Immersion 4.3.2.1. Sense Restraint ^n213 And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? 
When a noble disciple sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. 
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. 
When they hear a sound with their ears … 
When they smell an odor with their nose … 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue … 
When they feel a touch with their body … 
When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. 
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. 
When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves. 
That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors. 
4.3.2.2. Mindfulness and Situational Awareness ^n214 And how does a mendicant have mindfulness and situational awareness? 
It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. 
That’s how a mendicant has mindfulness and situational awareness. 
4.3.2.3. Contentment ^n215 And how is a mendicant content? 
It’s when a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. 
They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. 
In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. 
That’s how a mendicant is content. 
4.3.2.4. Giving Up the Hindrances ^n216 When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, and this noble contentment, 
they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. 
After the meal, they return from alms-round, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. 
^n217 Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. 
Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. 
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. 
Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. 
Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. 
^n218 Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work, 
and his efforts proved successful. 
He would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partner. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
 
he’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n219 Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill. They’d lose their appetite and get physically weak. 
But after some time they’d recover from that illness, and regain their appetite and their strength. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
 
 
they’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n220 Suppose a person was imprisoned in a jail. 
But after some time they were released from jail, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
they’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n221 Suppose a person was a bondservant. They belonged to someone else and were unable to go where they wish. 
But after some time they’d be freed from servitude and become their own master, an emancipated individual able to go where they wish. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
they’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n222 Suppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road, which was perilous, with nothing to eat. 
But after some time they crossed over the desert safely, reaching the neighborhood of a village, a sanctuary free of peril. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
they’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n223 In the same way, as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards them thus as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing. 
^n224 But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and sanctuary. 
 
^n225 Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. 
4.3.2.5. First Absorption ^n226 Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. 
^n227 It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. 
This, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.2.6. Second Absorption ^n228 Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without applying the mind and keeping it connected. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
^n229 It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. 
But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.2.7. Third Absorption ^n230 Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. 
^n231 It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.2.8. Fourth Absorption ^n232 Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
^n233 It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth. 
In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.3. The Eight Knowledges 4.3.3.1. Knowledge and Vision ^n234 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. 
They understand: 
‘This body of mine is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. 
And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’ 
^n235 Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. 
And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown. 
And someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and check it: 
‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. 
And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. 
 
 
 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.3.2. Mind-Made Body ^n236 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward the creation of a mind-made body. 
From this body they create another body, physical, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. 
^n237 Suppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheath. 
They’d think: 
‘This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed and the sheath are different things. The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’ 
Or suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbard. 
They’d think: 
‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword and the scabbard are different things. The sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’ 
Or suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its slough. 
They’d think: 
‘This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake and the slough are different things. The snake has been drawn out from the slough.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward the creation of a mind-made body. 
From this body they create another body, physical, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.3.3. Psychic Powers ^n238 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward psychic power. 
They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. 
^n239 Suppose an expert potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay. They could produce any kind of pot that they like. 
Or suppose a deft ivory-carver or their apprentice had some well-prepared ivory. They could produce any kind of ivory item that they like. 
Or suppose a deft goldsmith or their apprentice had some well-prepared gold. They could produce any kind of gold item that they like. 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward psychic power. 
 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.3.4. Clairaudience ^n240 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward clairaudience. 
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. 
^n241 Suppose there was a person traveling along the road. They’d hear the sound of drums, clay drums, horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms. They’d think: ‘That’s the sound of drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of clay-drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms.’
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward clairaudience. 
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.3.5. Comprehending the Minds of Others ^n242 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of others. 
They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … immersed mind … unimmersed mind … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’. 
^n243 Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they had a spot they’d know ‘I have a spot,’ and if they had no spots they’d know ‘I have no spots.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of others. 
They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.3.6. Recollection of Past Lives ^n244 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward recollection of past lives. 
They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
^n245 Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward recollection of past lives. 
 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.3.7. Clairvoyance ^n246 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. 
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. 
^n247 Suppose there was a stilt longhouse at the central square. A person with good eyesight standing there might see people entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square. They’d think: ‘These are people entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. 
 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
4.3.3.8. Ending of Defilements ^n248 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. 
They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. 
Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. 
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
^n249 Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still. They’d think: ‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. 
 
 
 
 
 
This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. 
And, great king, there is no other fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life which is better and finer than this.” 
5. Ajātasattu Declares Himself a Lay Follower ^n250 When the Buddha had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him, 
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. 
I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to take the life of my father, a just and principled king, for the sake of authority. 
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” 
^n251 “Indeed, great king, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to take the life of your father, a just and principled king, for the sake of sovereignty. 
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. 
For it is growth in the training of the noble one to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” 
^n252 When the Buddha had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him, 
“Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” 
“Please, great king, go at your convenience.” 
Then the king, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
^n253 Soon after the king had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
“The king is broken, mendicants,
he is ruined. 
If he had not taken the life of his father, a just and principled king, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma would have arisen in him in that very seat.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. 

^ck#d3(With Ambaṭṭha )^n254 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. 
He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. 
1. The Section on Pokkharasāti ^n255 Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti was living in Ukkaṭṭhā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. 
Pokkharasāti heard: 
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
2. The Brahmin Student Ambaṭṭha ^n256 Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a student named Ambaṭṭha. He was one who recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered in the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. He had been authorized as a master in his own teacher’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas with the words:
“What I know, you know.
And what you know, I know.” 
^n257 Then Pokkharasāti addressed Ambaṭṭha, 
“Dear Ambaṭṭha, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby. … 
 
 
 
 
It’s good to see such perfected ones. 
Please, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation. 
Through you I shall learn about Master Gotama.”
^n258 “But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?” 
“Dear Ambaṭṭha, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. 
If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. 
He has the following seven treasures: 
the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. 
He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. 
After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. 
But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. 
But, dear Ambaṭṭha, I am the one who gives the hymns,
and you are the one who receives them.” 
^n259 “Yes, sir,” replied Ambaṭṭha. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti, keeping him to his right. He mounted a mare-drawn chariot and, together with several students, set out for the forest near Icchānaṅgala.
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. 
At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air. 
Then the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those mendicants and said, 
“Gentlemen, where is Master Gotama at present? 
For we have come here to see him.”
^n260 Then those mendicants thought, 
“This Ambaṭṭha is from a well-known family, and he is the pupil of the well-known brahmin Pokkharasāti. 
The Buddha won’t mind having a discussion together with such gentlemen.” 
They said to Ambaṭṭha, 
“Ambaṭṭha, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock with the latch. The Buddha will open the door.” 
^n261 So he approached the Buddha’s dwelling and knocked, and the Buddha opened the door. 
Ambaṭṭha and the other students entered the dwelling. The other students exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, sat down to one side.
But while the Buddha was sitting, Ambaṭṭha spoke some polite words or other while walking around or standing. 
^n262 So the Buddha said to him, 
“Ambaṭṭha, is this how you hold a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers: walking around or standing while I’m sitting, speaking some polite words or other?” 
2.1. The First Use of the Word “Riffraff” ^n263 “No, Master Gotama. 
For it is proper for one brahmin to converse with another while both are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. 
But as to these shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, I converse with them as I do with Master Gotama.” 
“But Ambaṭṭha, you must have come here for some purpose. You should focus on that. 
Though this Ambaṭṭha is unqualified, he thinks he’s qualified. What is that but lack of qualifications?” 
^n264 When he said this, Ambaṭṭha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of being described as unqualified. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying, 
“The ascetic Gotama will be worsted!” He said to the Buddha, 
“Master Gotama, the Sakyan clan are rude, 
harsh, 
touchy, 
and argumentative.
Riffraff they are, and riffraff they remain! They don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins. 
It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—riffraff that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.” 
And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the first time. 
2.2. The Second Use of the Word “Riffraff” ^n265 “But Ambaṭṭha, how have the Sakyans wronged you?” 
“This one time, Master Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher, the brahmin Pokkharasāti. 
I approached the Sakyans in their meeting hall. 
Now at that time several Sakyans and Sakyan princes were sitting on high seats, poking each other with their fingers, giggling and playing together. In fact, they even presumed to giggle at me, and didn’t invite me to a seat. 
It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—riffraff that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.” 
And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the second time. 
2.3. The Third Use of the Word “Riffraff” ^n266 “Even a little quail, Ambaṭṭha, speaks as she likes in her own nest. 
Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans own place, Ambaṭṭha. It’s not worthy of the Venerable Ambaṭṭha to lose his temper over such a small thing.”
“Master Gotama, there are these four castes: 
aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers. 
Three of these castes—
aristocrats, merchants, and workers—
in fact succeed only in serving the brahmins. 
It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—riffraff that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.” 
And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the third time. 
2.4. The Word “Son of Bondservants” is Used ^n267 Then it occurred to the Buddha, 
“This Ambaṭṭha puts the Sakyans down too much by calling them riffraff. Why don’t I ask him about his own clan?” 
So the Buddha said to him, 
“What is your clan, Ambaṭṭha?” 
“I am a Kaṇhāyana, Master Gotama.” 
“But, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a female bondservant of the Sakyans.
But the Sakyans claim King Okkāka as their grandfather. 
Once upon a time, King Okkāka, wishing to divert the royal succession to the son of his most beloved queen, banished the elder princes from the realm—
Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika, and Sinisūra. 
They made their home beside a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, where there was a large teak grove. 
For fear of diluting their lineage, they slept with their own sisters.
Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and counselors, 
‘Where, sirs, have the princes settled now?’
‘Sire, there is a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, by a large grove of _sāka_, the teak tree. They’ve settled there. 
For fear of diluting their lineage, they are sleeping with their own (_saka_) sisters.’ 
Then, Ambaṭṭha, King Okkāka expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
‘The princes are indeed Sakyans! The princes are indeed the best Sakyans!’
From that day on the Sakyans were recognized, and he was their founder. 
Now, King Okkāka had a female bondservant named Disā. 
She gave birth to a black boy.
When he was born, Black Boy said: 
‘Wash me, mum, bathe me! Get this filth off of me! I will be useful for you!’
Whereas these days when people see goblins they know them as goblins, 
in those days they knew goblins as ‘blackboys’. 
They said: 
‘He spoke as soon as he was born—a blackboy is born! A goblin is born!’ 
From that day on the Kaṇhāyanas were recognized, and he was their founder. 
That’s how, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a female bondservant of the Sakyans.” 
^n268 When he said this, those students said to him, 
“Master Gotama, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant. 
He’s well-born, a gentleman, learned, a good speaker, and astute. He’s capable of having a dialogue with Master Gotama about this.” 
^n269 So the Buddha said to them, 
“Well, students, if you think that 
Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not a gentleman, uneducated, a poor speaker, witless, and not capable of having a dialogue with me about this, then leave him aside and you can have a dialogue with me. 
But if you think that 
he’s well-born, a gentleman, learned, a good speaker, astute, and capable of having a dialogue with me about this, then you should stand aside and let him have a dialogue with me.” 
 
“He is capable of having a dialogue. We will be silent, and let Ambaṭṭha have a dialogue with Master Gotama.” 
^n270 So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha, 
“Well, Ambaṭṭha, there’s a legitimate question that comes up. You won’t like it, but you ought to answer anyway. 
If you don’t answer, but dodge the issue, remain silent, or simply leave, your head will explode into seven pieces right here.
What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers, what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and who is their founder?” 
When he said this, Ambaṭṭha kept silent. 
For a second time, the Buddha put the question, 
 
and for a second time Ambaṭṭha kept silent. 
So the Buddha said to him, 
“Answer now, Ambaṭṭha. Now is not the time for silence. 
If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha, their head explodes into seven pieces there and then.” 
^n271 Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇi, holding a massive iron spear, burning, blazing, and glowing, stood in the sky above Ambaṭṭha, thinking,
“If this Ambaṭṭha doesn’t answer when asked a third time, I’ll blow his head into seven pieces there and then!” 
And both the Buddha and Ambaṭṭha could see Vajirapāṇi. 
^n272 Ambaṭṭha was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Looking to the Buddha for shelter, protection, and refuge, he sat down close by the Buddha and said, 
“What did you say? 
Please repeat the question.” 
“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers, what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and who is their founder?” 
“I have heard, Master Gotama, that it is just as you say. 
That’s the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, 
and that’s who their founder is.” 
2.5. The Discussion of Ambaṭṭha’s Heritage ^n273 When he said this, those students made an uproar, 
“It turns out Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not a gentleman, son of a Sakyan bondservant, and that the Sakyans are sons of his masters! 
And it seems that the ascetic Gotama spoke only the truth, though we presumed to rebuke him!” 
^n274 Then it occurred to the Buddha, 
“These students put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant. Why don’t I get him out of this?” 
So the Buddha said to the students, 
“Students, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant. 
That Black Boy was an eminent sage. 
He went to a southern country and memorized the Prime Spell. Then he approached King Okkāka and asked for the hand of his daughter Maddarūpī.
The king said to him, 
‘Who the hell is this son of a bondservant to ask for the hand of my daughter!’ Angry and upset he fastened a razor-tipped arrow. 
But he wasn’t able to either shoot it or to relax it. 
Then the ministers and counselors approached the sage Black Boy and said: 
‘Spare the king, sir, 
spare him!’ 
‘The king will be safe. But if he shoots the arrow downwards, there will be an earthquake across the entire realm.’ 
‘Spare the king, sir, and spare the country!’ 
‘Both king and country will be safe. But if he shoots the arrow upwards, there will be no rain in the entire realm for seven years.’ 
‘Spare the king, sir, spare the country, and let there be rain!’
‘Both king and country will be safe, and the rain will fall. And if the king aims the arrow at the crown prince, he will be safe and untouched.’
So the ministers said to Okkāka:
‘Okkāka must aim the arrow at the crown prince. He will be safe and untouched.’ 
So King Okkāka aimed the arrow at the crown prince. And he was safe and untouched. 
Then the king was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Scared by the prime punishment, he gave the hand of his daughter Maddarūpī.
Students, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant. That Black Boy was an eminent sage.”
3. The Supremacy of the Aristocrats ^n275 Then the Buddha addressed Ambaṭṭha, 
“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Suppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a brahmin girl, and they had a son. 
Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?” 
“He would, Master Gotama.” 
“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?” 
“They would.” 
“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?” 
“They would.” 
“And would he be kept from the women or not?”
“He would not.” 
“And would the aristocrats anoint him as king?” 
“No, Master Gotama. 
Why is that? 
Because his maternity is unsuitable.” 
“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Suppose a brahmin boy was to sleep with an aristocrat girl, and they had a son. 
Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?” 
“He would, Master Gotama.” 
“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?” 
“They would.” 
“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?” 
“They would.” 
“And would he be kept from the women or not?” 
“He would not.” 
“And would the aristocrats anoint him as king?” 
“No, Master Gotama. 
Why is that? 
Because his paternity is unsuitable.” 
^n276 “And so, Ambaṭṭha, the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferior, whether comparing women with women or men with men. 
What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Suppose the brahmins for some reason were to shave a brahmin’s head, inflict him with a sack of ashes, and banish him from the nation or the city. 
Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“And would he be kept from the women or not?” 
“He would be.” 
“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Suppose the aristocrats for some reason were to shave an aristocrat’s head, inflict him with a sack of ashes, and banish him from the nation or the city. 
Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?” 
“He would, Master Gotama.”
“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?” 
“They would.” 
“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?” 
“They would.” 
“And would he be kept from the women or not?” 
“He would not.” 
^n277 “At this point, Ambaṭṭha, that aristocrat has reached rock bottom, with head shaven, inflicted with a sack of ashes, and banished from city or nation. 
Yet still the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferior. 
Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse: 
‘The aristocrat is best of those people 
who take clan as the standard. 
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct 
is best of gods and humans.’ 
That verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by me. 
For I also say this: 
The aristocrat is best of those people 
who take clan as the standard. 
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct 
is best of gods and humans.” 
 
4. Knowledge and Conduct ^n278 “But what, Master Gotama, is that conduct, and what is that knowledge?”
“Ambaṭṭha, in the supreme knowledge and conduct there is no discussion of ancestry or clan or pride—
‘You deserve me’ or ‘You don’t deserve me.’ 
Wherever there is giving and taking in marriage there is such discussion. 
 
Whoever is attached to questions of ancestry or clan or pride, or to giving and taking in marriage, is far from the supreme knowledge and conduct. 
The realization of supreme knowledge and conduct occurs when you’ve given up such things.” 
^n279 “But what, Master Gotama, is that conduct, and what is that knowledge?” 
“Ambaṭṭha, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some clan. 
They gain faith in the Realized One, 
and reflect … 
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption … 
This pertains to their conduct. 
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption … 
This pertains to their conduct. 
Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption … 
This pertains to their conduct. 
Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption … 
This pertains to their conduct. 
This is that conduct. 
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. 
This pertains to their knowledge. … 
They understand: ‘There is no return to any state of existence.’ 
This pertains to their knowledge. 
This is that knowledge. 
This mendicant is said to be ‘accomplished in knowledge’, and also ‘accomplished in conduct’, and also ‘accomplished in knowledge and conduct’. 
And, Ambaṭṭha, there is no accomplishment in knowledge and conduct that is better or finer than this. 
5. Four Drains ^n280 There are these four drains that affect this supreme knowledge and conduct.
What four? 
Firstly, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, plunges into a wilderness region carrying their stuff with a shoulder-pole, thinking 
they will get by eating fallen fruit. 
In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct.
This is the first drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct. 
Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit, plunges into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket, thinking 
they will get by eating tubers and fruit. 
In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. 
This is the second drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct. 
Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or to get by eating tubers and fruit, sets up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwells there serving the sacred flame. 
In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. 
This is the third drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct. 
Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or to get by eating tubers and fruit, or to serve the sacred flame, sets up a fire chamber in the central square and dwells there, thinking: 
‘When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters, I will honor them as best I can.’ 
In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. 
This is the fourth drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct. 
These are the four drains that affect this supreme knowledge and conduct. 
^n281 What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Is this supreme knowledge and conduct seen in your own tradition?” 
“No, Master Gotama. 
Who am I and my tradition compared with the supreme knowledge and conduct? 
We are far from that.” 
“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Since you’re not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, have you with your tradition plunged into a wilderness region carrying your stuff with a shoulder-pole, thinking 
you will get by eating fallen fruit?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Have you with your tradition … plunged into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket, thinking 
you will get by eating tubers and fruit?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Have you with your tradition … set up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwelt there serving the sacred flame?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
Have you with your tradition … set up a fire chamber in the central square and dwelt there, thinking: 
‘When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters, I will honor them as best I can’?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
^n282 “So you with your tradition are not only inferior to the supreme knowledge and conduct, 
you are even inferior to the four drains that affect the supreme knowledge and conduct. 
But you have been told this by your teacher, the brahmin Pokkharasāti: 
‘Who are these shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman compared with conversation with the brahmins of the three knowledges?” Yet he himself has not even fulfilled one of the drains! 
See, Ambaṭṭha, how your teacher Pokkharasāti has wronged you.
6. Being Like the Sages of the Past ^n283 But Pokkharasāti lives off an endowment provided by King Pasenadi of Kosala. 
But the king won’t even grant him an audience face to face. 
When he consults, he does so behind a curtain.
Why wouldn’t the king grant a face to face audience with someone who’d receive his legitimate presentation of food? 
See, Ambaṭṭha, how your teacher Pokkharasāti has wronged you. 
^n284 What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?
Suppose King Pasenadi was holding consultations with warrior-chiefs or chieftains while sitting on an elephant’s neck or on horseback, or while standing on the mat in a chariot. 
And suppose he’d get down from that place and stand aside. 
Then along would come a worker or their bondservant, who’d stand in the same place and continue the consultation: 
‘This is what King Pasenadi says, and this too is what the king says.’ 
Though he spoke the king’s words and gave the king’s advice,
does that qualify him to be the king or the king’s minister?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
^n285 “In the same way, Ambaṭṭha, the brahmin seers of the past were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught. 
You might imagine that, since you’ve learned their hymns by heart in your own tradition, that makes you a hermit or someone on the path to becoming a hermit. But that is not possible. 
^n286 What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? 
According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers, 
did those brahmin hermits of the past—
nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, bedecked with jewels, earrings, and bracelets, dressed in white—amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, like you do today in your tradition?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
 
“Did they eat boiled fine rice, garnished with clean meat, with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces, like you do today in your tradition?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
 
“Did they amuse themselves with girls wearing thongs that show off their curves, like you do today in your tradition?”
“No, Master Gotama.” 
 
“Did they drive about in chariots drawn by mares with plaited manes, whipping and lashing them onward with long goads, like you do today in your tradition?”
“No, Master Gotama.” 
 
“Did they get men with long swords to guard them in fortresses with moats dug and barriers in place, like you do today in your tradition?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“So, Ambaṭṭha, in your own tradition you are neither hermit nor someone on the path to becoming a hermit. 
Whoever has any doubt or uncertainty about me, let them ask me and I will clear up their doubts with my answer.” 
7. Seeing the Two Marks ^n287 Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and proceeded to begin walking mindfully, 
and Ambaṭṭha did likewise. 
Then while walking beside the Buddha, Ambaṭṭha scrutinized his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man. 
He saw all of them except for two, 
which he had doubts about: 
whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue. 
^n288 Then it occurred to the Buddha, 
“This brahmin student Ambaṭṭha sees all the marks except for two, 
which he has doubts about: 
whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.” 
Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Ambaṭṭha would see his retracted private parts. 
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue. 
Then Ambaṭṭha thought, 
“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.” 
He said to the Buddha, 
“Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” 
“Please, Ambaṭṭha, go at your convenience.” 
Then Ambaṭṭha mounted his mare-drawn chariot and left. 
^n289 Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti had come out from Ukkaṭṭhā together with a large group of brahmins and was sitting in his own park just waiting for Ambaṭṭha. 
Then Ambaṭṭha entered the park. 
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the brahmin Pokkharasāti on foot. He bowed
^n290  and sat down to one side, and Pokkharasāti said to him:
“I hope, dear Ambaṭṭha, you saw the Master Gotama?” 
“I saw him, sir.” 
“Well, does he live up to his reputation or not?” 
 
“He does, sir. 
Master Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.” 
“And did you have some discussion with him?” 
“I did.” 
“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?” 
Then Ambaṭṭha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed. 
^n291 Then Pokkharasāti said to Ambaṭṭha, 
“Oh, our bloody fake scholar, our fake learned man, who pretends to be proficient in the three Vedas! A man who behaves like this ought, when their body breaks up, after death, to be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
It’s only because you repeatedly attacked Master Gotama like that that he kept bringing up charges against us!” 
Angry and upset, he kicked Ambaṭṭha over, 
and wanted to go and see the Buddha right away. 
8. Pokkharasāti Visits the Buddha ^n292 Then those brahmins said to Pokkharasāti, 
“It’s much too late to visit the ascetic Gotama today. 
You can visit him tomorrow.”
So Pokkharasāti had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he mounted a carriage and, with attendants carrying torches, set out from Ukkaṭṭhā for the forest near Icchānaṅgala. 
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over,
^n293  he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
“Master Gotama, has my pupil, the student Ambaṭṭha, come here?” 
“Yes he has, brahmin.” 
“And did you have some discussion with him?” 
“I did.” 
“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?” 
Then the Buddha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed. 
Then Pokkharasāti said to the Buddha, 
“Ambaṭṭha is a fool, Master Gotama. Please forgive him.” 
“May the student Ambaṭṭha be happy, brahmin.” 
^n294 Then Pokkharasāti scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man. 
He saw all of them except for two, 
which he had doubts about: 
whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue. 
^n295 Then it occurred to the Buddha, 
“Pokkharasāti sees all the marks except for two, 
which he has doubts about: 
whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.” 
Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Pokkharasāti would see his retracted private parts. 
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue. 
^n296 Pokkharasāti thought, 
“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.” 
He said to the Buddha, 
“Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?” 
The Buddha consented in silence. 
^n297 Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Pokkharasāti announced the time to him, 
“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Pokkharasāti together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
Then Pokkharasāti served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods, while his students served the Saṅgha. 
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Pokkharasāti took a low seat and sat to one side. 
^n298 Then the Buddha taught him step by step, with 
a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. 
He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. 
And when the Buddha knew that Pokkharasāti’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, joyful, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: 
suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, 
in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Pokkharasāti: 
“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” 
9. Pokkharasāti Declares Himself a Lay Follower ^n299 Then Pokkharasāti saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, just so has Master Gotama made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
Together with my children, wives, retinue, and ministers, I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. 
Just as Master Gotama visits other devoted families in Ukkaṭṭhā, may he visit mine. 
The brahmin boys and girls there will bow to you, rise in your presence, give you a seat and water, and gain confidence in their hearts. That will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” 
“That’s good of you to say, householder.” 

^ck#d4(With Soṇadaṇḍa )1. The Brahmins and Householders of Campā ^n300 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Aṅgas together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Campā, 
where he stayed by the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. 
Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living in Campā. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. 
^n301 The brahmins and householders of Campā heard: 
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
Then, having departed Campā, they formed into companies and headed to the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. 
^n302 Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. 
He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the lotus pond, 
and addressed his steward, 
“My steward, why are the brahmins and householders headed for the Gaggarā Lotus Pond?” 
“The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
They’re going to see that Master Gotama.” 
“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: 
‘Sirs, the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa asks 
you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’” 
“Yes, sir,” replied the steward, and did as he was asked. 
 
 
2. The Qualities of Soṇadaṇḍa ^n303 Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Campā on some business. 
They heard that 
the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was going to see the ascetic Gotama. 
They approached Soṇadaṇḍa and said to him, 
“Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?” 
“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.” 
 
“Please don’t, master Soṇadaṇḍa! 
It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama.
For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase. 
For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; 
it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. 
You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. 
For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; 
it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. 
You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy. … 
You recite and remember the hymns, and are have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. You know philology and grammar, and are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. … 
You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You are magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. … 
You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. … 
You’re a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. … 
You teach the teachers of many, and teach three hundred students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. … 
You’re old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. 
The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone forth. … 
You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha … 
and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. … 
You live in Campā, a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. 
 
For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; 
it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. 
3. The Qualities of the Buddha ^n304 When they had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins: 
“Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama, 
and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me. 
He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. 
For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me; 
rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. 
When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle. … 
When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. … 
He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. … 
Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. … 
He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. … 
He is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful. … 
He’s a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. … 
He’s a teacher of teachers. … 
He has ended sensual desire, and is rid of caprice. … 
He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action. He doesn’t wish any harm upon the community of brahmins. … 
He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage. … 
He went forth from a rich, affluent, and wealthy family. … 
People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him. … 
Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him. … 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ … 
He has the thirty-two marks of a great man. … 
He is welcoming, congenial, polite, smiling, open, the first to speak. …
He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by the four assemblies. … 
Many gods and humans are devoted to him. … 
While he is residing in a village or town, non-human entities do not harass them. … 
He leads an order and a community, and teaches a community, and is said to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn’t come by his fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins. 
Rather, he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct. … 
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … 
King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … 
The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … 
He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha … 
King Pasenadi of Kosala … 
and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. 
The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying at the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. 
Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest, 
and should be honored and respected as such. 
 
 
For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me; 
rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. 
This is the extent of Master Gotama’s praise that I have learned. But his praises are not confined to this, 
for the praise of Master Gotama is limitless.” 
^n305 When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, 
“According to Soṇadaṇḍa’s praises, if Master Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues, it’d be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a shoulder bag.” 
“Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.” 
4. Soṇadaṇḍa’s Second Thoughts ^n306 Then Soṇadaṇḍa together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha. 
But as he reached the far side of the forest, this thought came to mind, 
“Suppose I was to ask the ascetic Gotama a question. 
He might say to me: 
‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t ask your question like that. This is how you should ask it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that: 
‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to properly ask the ascetic Gotama a question.’ 
And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. 
When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. 
But my wealth relies on my reputation. 
Or if the ascetic Gotama asks me a question, I might not satisfy him with my answer. 
He might say to me: 
‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t answer the question like that. This is how you should answer it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that: 
‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to satisfy the ascetic Gotama’s mind with his answer.’ 
And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. 
When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. 
But my wealth relies on my reputation. 
On the other hand, if I were to turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama, the assembly might disparage me for that: 
‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s stuck-up and scared. He doesn’t dare to go and see the ascetic Gotama. For how on earth can he turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama!’ 
And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. 
When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. 
But my wealth relies on my reputation.” 
^n307 Then Soṇadaṇḍa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. 
Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Campā bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. 
^n308 But while sitting there, Soṇadaṇḍa continued to be plagued by many second thoughts. He thought,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“If only the ascetic Gotama would ask me about my own teacher’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas! Then I could definitely satisfy his mind with my answer.” 
5. What Makes a Brahmin ^n309 Then the Buddha, knowing what Soṇadaṇḍa was thinking, thought, 
“This brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is worried by his own thoughts. 
Why don’t I ask him about his own teacher’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas?” 
So he said to Soṇadaṇḍa, 
“Brahmin, how many factors must a brahmin possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; 
and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood?” 
^n310 Then Soṇadaṇḍa thought, 
“The ascetic Gotama has asked me about exactly what I wanted, what I wished for, what I desired, what I yearned for; that is, my own scriptural heritage. 
 
I can definitely satisfy his mind with my answer.” 
^n311 Then Soṇadaṇḍa straightened his back, looked around the assembly, and said to the Buddha, 
“Master Gotama, a brahmin must possess five factors for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; 
and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood. 
What five? 
It’s when a brahmin is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. 
He recites and remembers the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knows philology and grammar, and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. 
He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. 
He is ethical, mature in ethical conduct. 
He’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. 
These are the five factors which a brahmin must possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; 
and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood.” 
“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these five factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” 
 
“It is possible, Master Gotama. 
We could leave appearance out of the five factors. 
For what does appearance matter? 
 
 
 
 
A brahmin must possess the remaining four factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” 
 
^n312 “But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these four factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” 
 
“It is possible, Master Gotama. 
We could leave the hymns out of the five factors. 
For what do the hymns matter?
 
 
 
A brahmin must possess the remaining three factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” 
 
“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these three factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” 
 
“It is possible, Master Gotama. 
We could leave birth out of the five factors. 
For what does birth matter? 
It’s when a brahmin is ethical, mature in ethical conduct; 
and he’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. 
A brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” 
 
^n313 When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, 
“Please don’t say that, Master Soṇadaṇḍa, please don’t say that! 
You’re just condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You’re totally going over to the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine!” 
^n314 So the Buddha said to them, 
“Well, brahmins, if you think that 
Soṇadaṇḍa is uneducated, a poor speaker, witless, and not capable of having a dialogue with me about this, then leave him aside and you can have a dialogue with me. 
But if you think that 
he’s learned, a good speaker, astute, and capable of having a dialogue with me about this, then you should stand aside and let him have a dialogue with me.” 
^n315 When he said this, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha, 
“Let it be, Master Gotama, be silent. I myself will respond to them in a legitimate manner.” 
Then he said to those brahmins, 
“Don’t say this, gentlemen, don’t say this: 
‘You’re just condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You’re totally going over to the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine!’ 
I’m not condemning appearance, hymns, or birth.” 
^n316 Now at that time Soṇadaṇḍa’s nephew, the student Aṅgaka was sitting in that assembly. 
Then Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins, 
“Gentlemen, do you see my nephew, the student Aṅgaka?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“Aṅgaka is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. There’s no-one in this assembly so good-looking, apart from the ascetic Gotama. 
Aṅgaka recites and remembers the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knows philology and grammar, and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. 
And I am the one who teaches him the hymns. 
Aṅgaka is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. 
And I know his mother and father. 
But if Aṅgaka were to kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, and drink alcohol, then what’s the use of his appearance, his hymns, or his birth? 
It’s when a brahmin is ethical, mature in ethical conduct; 
and he’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. 
A brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” 
 
6. The Discussion of Ethics and Wisdom ^n317 “But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these two factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” 
 
“No, Master Gotama. 
For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. 
Ethics and wisdom always go together. 
An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. 
And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world. 
It’s just like when you clean one hand with the other, or clean one foot with the other. 
In the same way, wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. 
Ethics and wisdom always go together. 
An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. 
And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world.” 
“That’s so true, brahmin, that’s so true! For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. 
Ethics and wisdom always go together. 
An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. 
And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world. 
It’s just like when you clean one hand with the other, or clean one foot with the other. 
In the same way, wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. 
Ethics and wisdom always go together. 
An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. 
And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world. 
^n318 But what, brahmin, is that ethical conduct? 
And what is that wisdom?” 
“That’s all I know about this matter, Master Gotama. 
May Master Gotama himself please clarify the meaning of this.” 
“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes sir,” Soṇadaṇḍa replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. 
This, brahmin, is that ethical conduct. … 
They enter and remain in the first absorption … 
second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption … 
They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … 
This pertains to their wisdom. … 
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
This, brahmin, is that wisdom.” 
7. Soṇadaṇḍa Declares Himself a Lay Follower ^n319 When he had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. 
Would you and the Order of monks please accept a meal from me tomorrow?” 
The Buddha consented in silence. 
^n320 Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Soṇadaṇḍa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
And when the night had passed Soṇadaṇḍa had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, 
“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Soṇadaṇḍa together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
Then Soṇadaṇḍa served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. 
^n321 When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Soṇadaṇḍa took a low seat and sat to one side. 
Seated to one side he said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, if, when I have gone to an assembly, I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for that. 
And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. 
When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. 
But my wealth relies on my reputation. 
If, when I have gone to an assembly, I raise my joined palms, please take it that I have risen from my seat. 
And if I undo my turban, please take it that I have bowed. 
And Master Gotama, if, when I am in a carriage, I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for that. 
 
 
If, when I am in a carriage, I hold up my goad, please take it that I have got down from my carriage. 
And if I lower my sunshade, please take it that I have bowed.” 
^n322 Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. 

^ck#d5(With Kūṭadanta )1. The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata ^n323 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Magadhan brahmins named Khāṇumata. 
There he stayed nearby at Ambalaṭṭhikā.
Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. 
Now at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrifice. 
Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams—seven hundred of each—had been led to the post for the sacrifice. 
^n324 The brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka heard: 
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Khāṇumataka and is staying in a forest nearby. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
^n325 Then, having departed Khāṇumataka, they formed into companies and headed to Ambalaṭṭhikā. 
^n326 Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. 
He saw the brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikā, 
and addressed his steward, 
“My steward, why are the brahmins and householders headed for Ambalaṭṭhikā?” 
^n327 “The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumataka and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
They’re going to see that Master Gotama.” 
^n328 Then Kūṭadanta thought, 
“I’ve heard that 
the ascetic Gotama knows how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories. 
I don’t know about that, 
but I wish to perform a great sacrifice. 
Why don’t I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories?” 
^n329 Then Kūṭadanta addressed his steward, 
“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: 
‘Sirs, the brahmin Kūṭadanta asks 
you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’” 
“Yes, sir,” replied the steward, and did as he was asked. 
 
 
2. The Qualities of Kūṭadanta ^n330 Now at that time several hundred brahmins were residing in Khāṇumata 
thinking to participate in Kūṭadanta’s sacrifice. 
They heard that 
Kūṭadanta was going to see the ascetic Gotama. 
They approached Kūṭadanta
^n331  and said to him:
“Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?” 
“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.” 
 
“Please don’t! 
It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama. 
For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase. 
For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; 
it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. 
You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. 
For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; 
it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. 
You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain … 
You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. You know philology and grammar, and are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. … 
You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You are magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. … 
You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. … 
You’re a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. … 
You teach the teachers of many, and teach three hundred students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. … 
You’re old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. 
The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone forth. … 
You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha … 
and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. … 
You live in Khāṇumata, a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. 
For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; 
it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.” 
3. The Qualities of the Buddha ^n332 When they had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to those brahmins: 
“Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama, 
and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me. 
He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. 
For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me; 
rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. 
When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle. … 
When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. … 
He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. … 
Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. … 
He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. … 
He is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful. … 
He’s a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. … 
He’s a teacher of teachers. … 
He has ended sensual desire, and is rid of caprice. … 
He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action. He doesn’t wish any harm upon the community of brahmins. … 
He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage. … 
He went forth from a rich, affluent, and wealthy family. … 
People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him. … 
Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him. … 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ … 
He has the thirty-two marks of a great man. … 
He is welcoming, congenial, polite, smiling, open, the first to speak. … 
He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by the four assemblies. … 
Many gods and humans are devoted to him. … 
While he is residing in a village or town, non-human entities do not harass them. … 
He leads an order and a community, and teaches a community, and is said to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn’t come by his fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins. 
Rather, he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct. … 
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … 
King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … 
The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … 
He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha … 
King Pasenadi of Kosala … 
and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. 
The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. 
Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest, 
and should be honored and respected as such. 
 
 
For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me, 
rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. 
This is the extent of Master Gotama’s praise that I have learned. But his praises are not confined to this, 
for the praise of Master Gotama is limitless.” 
^n333 When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, 
“According to Kūṭadanta’s praises, if Master Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues, it’d be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a shoulder bag.” 
“Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.” 
4. The Story of King Mahāvijita’s Sacrifice ^n334 Then Kūṭadanta together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. 
Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. 
^n335 Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, 
“Master Gotama, I’ve heard that 
you know how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories. 
I don’t know about that, 
but I wish to perform a great sacrifice. 
Please teach me how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.” 
^n336 “Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes sir,” Kūṭadanta replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
Once upon a time, brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses. 
Then as King Mahāvijita was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: 
‘I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I hold a large sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ 
^n337 Then he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him: 
‘Just now, brahmin, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind, 
“I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I perform a great sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” 
Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. 
Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ 
^n338 When he had spoken, the brahmin high priest said to him: 
‘Sir, the king’s realm is harried and oppressed. Bandits have been seen raiding villages, towns, and cities, and infesting the highways. 
But if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed, he would not be doing his duty. 
Now the king might think, 
“I’ll eradicate this barbarian obstacle by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment!” But that’s not the right way to eradicate this barbarian obstacle. 
Those who remain after the killing will return to harass the king’s realm. 
Rather, here is a plan, relying on which the barbarian obstacle will be properly uprooted. 
So let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in farming and raising cattle. 
Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade. 
Let the king guarantee food and wages for those in government service. 
Then the people, occupied with their own work, will not harass the realm. 
The king’s revenues will be great. 
When the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, will dwell as if their houses were wide open.’ 
The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation. 
 
 
 
 
Then the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him: 
‘I have eradicated the barbarian obstacle. And relying on your plan my revenue is now great. 
Since the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, dwell as if their houses were wide open. 
Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. 
Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ 
4.1. The Four Accessories ^n339 ‘In that case, let the king announce this throughout the realm to the aristocrat vassals, ministers and counselors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders, both of town and country: 
“I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please grant your approval, gentlemen; it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” 
The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation. 
And all of the people who were thus informed responded by saying: 
‘May the king perform a sacrifice! It is time for a sacrifice, great king.’ 
 
 
 
And so these four consenting factions became accessories to the sacrifice. 
4.2. The Eight Accessories ^n340 King Mahāvijita possessed eight factors. 
He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. 
He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He was magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. 
He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses. 
He was powerful, having an army of four divisions that was obedient and carried out instructions. He’d probably prevail over his enemies just with his reputation.
He was faithful, generous, a donor, his door always open. He was a well-spring of support, making merit with ascetics and brahmins, for paupers, vagrants, travelers, and beggars.
He was very learned in diverse fields of learning. He understood the meaning of diverse statements, saying: 
‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’ 
He was astute, competent, and intelligent, able to think issues through as they bear upon the past, future, and present. 
These are the eight factors that King Mahāvijita possessed. 
And so these eight factors also became accessories to the sacrifice. 
4.3. Four More Accessories ^n341 And the brahmin high priest had four factors. 
He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. 
He recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. 
He was ethical, mature in ethical conduct. 
He was astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. 
These are the four factors that the brahmin high priest possessed. 
And so these four factors also became accessories to the sacrifice. 
4.4. The Three Modes ^n342 Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest taught the three modes to the king. 
‘Now, though the king wants to perform a great sacrifice, he might have certain regrets, thinking: 
“I shall lose a great fortune,” or 
 
“I am losing a great fortune,” or 
 
“I have lost a great fortune.” But the king should not harbor such regrets.’ 
These are the three modes that the brahmin high priest taught to the king before the sacrifice. 
4.5. The Ten Respects ^n343 Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest dispelled the king’s regret regarding the recipients in ten respects: 
‘There will come to the sacrifice those who kill living creatures and those who refrain from killing living creatures. 
As to those who kill living creatures, the outcome of that is theirs alone. 
But as to those who refrain from killing living creatures, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.
There will come to the sacrifice those who steal … 
commit sexual misconduct … 
lie … 
use divisive speech … 
use harsh speech … 
talk nonsense … 
are covetous … 
have ill will … 
have wrong view and those who have right view. 
As to those who have wrong view, the outcome of that is theirs alone. 
But as to those who have right view, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.’ 
These are the ten respects in which the high priest dispelled the king’s regret regarding the recipients before the sacrifice. 
4.6. The Sixteen Respects ^n344 Next, while the king was performing the great sacrifice, the brahmin high priest educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the king’s mind in sixteen respects: 
‘Now, while the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say, 
“King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice, but he did not announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country. 
That’s the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs.” 
Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. 
For the king did indeed announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country. 
Let the king know this as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart. 
While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say, 
“King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice, but he did not announce it to the ministers and counselors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders, both of town and country. That’s the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs.” 
Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. 
For the king did indeed announce it to all these people. 
Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart. 
While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say 
that he does not possess the eight factors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. 
For the king does indeed possess the eight factors. 
Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart. 
While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say 
that the high priest does not possess the four factors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. 
For the high priest does indeed possess the four factors. 
Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.’ 
These are the sixteen respects in which the high priest educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the king’s mind while he was performing the sacrifice. 
^n345 And brahmin, in that sacrifice no cattle were killed, no goats were killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice. 
No bondservants, employees, or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. 
Those who wished to work did so, while those who did not wish to did not. 
They did the work they wanted to, and did not do what they didn’t want to. 
The sacrifice was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses. 
^n346 Then the aristocrat vassals, ministers and counselors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders of both town and country came to the king bringing abundant wealth and said, 
‘Sire, this abundant wealth is specially for you alone; may Your Highness accept it!’
‘There’s enough raised for me through regular taxes. Let this be for you; and here, take even more!’ 
 
When the king turned them down, they withdrew to one side to think up a plan, 
‘It wouldn’t be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to our own homes. 
King Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice. Let us make an offering as an auxiliary sacrifice.’ 
^n347 Then the aristocrat vassals of town and country set up gifts to the east of the sacrificial pit. 
The ministers and counselors of town and country set up gifts to the south of the sacrificial pit. 
The well-to-do brahmins of town and country set up gifts to the west of the sacrificial pit. 
The well-off householders of town and country set up gifts to the north of the sacrificial pit. 
And brahmin, in that sacrifice too no cattle were killed, no goats were killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice. 
No bondservants, employees, or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. 
Those who wished to work did so, while those who did not wish to did not. 
They did the work they wanted to, and did not do what they didn’t want to. 
The sacrifice was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses. 
And so there were four consenting factions, eight factors possessed by King Mahāvijita, four factors possessed by the high priest, 
and three modes. 
Brahmin, this is called the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories.” 
^n348 When he said this, those brahmins made an uproar, 
“Hooray for such sacrifice! Hooray for the accomplishment of such sacrifice!” 
But the brahmin Kūṭadanta sat in silence. 
So those brahmins said to him, 
“How can you not applaud the ascetic Gotama’s fine words?” 
“It’s not that I don’t applaud what he said. 
If anyone didn’t applaud such fine words, their head would explode! 
But, gentlemen, it occurs to me that 
the ascetic Gotama does not say: 
‘So I have heard’ or ‘It ought to be like this.’ 
Rather, he just says: 
‘So it was then, this is how it was then.’ 
It occurs to me that 
the ascetic Gotama at that time must have been King Mahāvijita, the owner of the sacrifice, or else the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice for him. 
Does Master Gotama recall having performed such a sacrifice, or having facilitated it, and then, when his body broke up, after death, being reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?” 
“I do recall that, brahmin. For at that time I was the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice.” 
5. A Regular Gift as an Ongoing Family Sacrifice. ^n349 “But Master Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” 
“There is, brahmin.” 
“But what is it?” 
“The regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates; 
this sacrifice, brahmin, has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial.” 
“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories?” 
“Because neither perfected ones nor those who have entered the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice. 
Why is that? 
Because beatings and throttlings are seen there. 
But the regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates; 
perfected ones and those who have entered the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice. 
Why is that? 
Because no beatings and throttlings are seen there. 
This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories.” 
^n350 “But Master Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories and those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” 
“There is, brahmin.” 
“But what is it?” 
“When someone gives a dwelling specially for the Saṅgha of the four quarters.” 
^n351 “But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” 
 
 
“When someone with confident heart goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.” 
 
^n352 “But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” 
 
 
“When someone with a confident heart undertakes the training rules 
to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.” 
 
^n353 “But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” 
“There is, brahmin. 
 
It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … 
They enter and remain in the first absorption … 
This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. … 
They enter and remain in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. … 
They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … 
This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. 
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. 
And, brahmin, there is no other accomplishment of sacrifice which is better and finer than this.” 
6. Kūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay Follower ^n354 When he had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. 
And these bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams—seven hundred of each—I release them, I grant them life! Let them eat green grass and drink cool water, and may a cool breeze blow upon them!” 
7. The Realization of the Fruit of Stream-Entry ^n355 Then the Buddha taught Kūṭadanta step by step, with 
a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. 
He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. 
And when he knew that Kūṭadanta’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, joyful, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: 
suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, 
in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Kūṭadanta: 
“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” 
^n356 Then Kūṭadanta saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, 
“Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” 
The Buddha consented in silence. 
^n357 Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Kūṭadanta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
And when the night had passed Kūṭadanta had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, 
“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” 
^n358 Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Kūṭadanta together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
Then Kūṭadanta served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. 
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Kūṭadanta took a low seat and sat to one side. 
Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. 

^ck#d6(With Mahāli )1. On the Brahmin Emissaries ^n359 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
Now at that time several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were residing in Vesālī on some business. 
They heard: 
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
^n360 Then they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood to see the Buddha. 
Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant. 
The brahmin emissaries went up to him and said, 
“Master Nāgita, where is Master Gotama at present? 
For we want to see him.” 
“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.” 
So the brahmin emissaries sat down to one side, thinking, 
“We’ll go only after we’ve seen Master Gotama.” 
2. On Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi ^n361 Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also approached Nāgita at the hall with the peaked roof. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita, 
“Master Nāgita, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha? 
For we want to see him.” 
“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.” 
So Oṭṭhaddha also sat down to one side, thinking, 
“I’ll go only after I’ve seen the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” 
^n362 Then the novice Sīha approached Nāgita. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita, 
“Sir, Kassapa, these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha, and also Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis, have come here to see the Buddha. It’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.” 
“Well then, Sīha, tell the Buddha yourself.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha. He went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of the people waiting to see him, adding: 
 
“Sir, it’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.” 
“Well then, Sīha, spread out a seat in the shade of the dwelling.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha, and he did so. 
^n363 Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread out. 
Then the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. 
Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha, bowed,
^n364  and sat down to one side. Oṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha, “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said:
‘Mahāli, soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years. I see heavenly sights that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, but I don’t hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing.’ 
The heavenly sounds that Sunakkhatta cannot hear: do such sounds really exist or not?” 
2.1. One-Sided Immersion ^n365 “Such sounds really do exist, but Sunakkhatta cannot hear them.” 
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear them, even though they really do exist?” 
^n366 “Mahāli, take a mendicant who has developed one-sided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds.
When they have developed immersion for that purpose, 
they see heavenly sights but don’t hear heavenly sounds. 
Why is that? 
Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. 
^n367 Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed one-sided immersion to the southern quarter … 
western quarter … 
northern quarter … 
above, below, across … 
 
 
 
That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. 
^n368 Take a mendicant who has developed one-sided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to hear heavenly sounds but not to see heavenly sights. 
When they have developed immersion for that purpose, 
they hear heavenly sounds but don’t see heavenly sights. 
Why is that? 
Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. 
^n369 Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed one-sided immersion to the southern quarter … 
western quarter … 
northern quarter … 
above, below, across … 
 
 
 
That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. 
^n370 Take a mendicant who has developed two-sided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to both hear heavenly sounds and see heavenly sights. 
When they have developed immersion for that purpose, 
they both see heavenly sights and hear heavenly sounds. 
Why is that? 
Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. 
^n371 Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed two-sided immersion to the southern quarter … 
western quarter … 
northern quarter … 
above, below, across … 
 
 
 
That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. 
This is the cause, Mahāli, this is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, even though they really do exist.” 
^n372 “Surely the mendicants must live the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing such a development of immersion?” 
“No, Mahāli, the mendicants don’t live the spiritual life under me for the sake of realizing such a development of immersion. 
There are other things that are finer, for the sake of which the mendicants live the spiritual life under me.” 
2.2. The Four Noble Fruits ^n373 “But sir, what are those finer things?” 
“Firstly, Mahāli, with the ending of three fetters a mendicant is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants live the spiritual life under me. 
Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. 
This too is one of the finer things. 
Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. 
This too is one of the finer things. 
Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
This too is one of the finer things. 
These are the finer things, for the sake of which the mendicants live the spiritual life under me.” 
2.3. The Noble Eightfold Path ^n374 “But, sir, is there a path and a practice for realizing these things?” 
“There is, Mahāli.” 
^n375 “Well, what is it?” 
“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
This is the path and the practice for realizing these things. 
2.4. On the Two Renunciates ^n376 This one time, Mahāli, I was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
Then two renunciates—
the wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya the pupil of Dārupattika—came and exchanged greetings with me.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said to me: 
‘Reverend Gotama, are the soul and the body the same thing, or they are different things?’ 
^n377 ‘Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.’ 
‘Yes, reverend,’ they replied. 
I said this: 
‘Take the case when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … 
 
They enter and remain in the first absorption. 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 
“The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”?’
‘It would, reverend.’ 
 
‘But reverends, I know and see like this. 
Nevertheless, I do not say: 
“The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”. … 
They enter and remain in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 
“The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”?’ 
‘It would, reverend.’ 
 
‘But reverends, I know and see like this. 
Nevertheless, I do not say: 
“The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”. … 
They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 
“The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”?’ 
 
‘It would, reverend.’ 
 
‘But reverends, I know and see like this. 
Nevertheless, I do not say: 
“The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”. … 
They understand: “… there is no return to any state of existence.” 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 
“The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”?’ 
‘It would not, reverend.’ 
 
‘But reverends, I know and see like this. 
Nevertheless, I do not say: 
“The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”.’” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi was happy with what the Buddha said. 

^ck#d7(With Jāliya )^n378 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
Now at that time two renunciates—
the wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya the pupil of Dārupattika—came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said to the Buddha, 
“Reverend Gotama, are the soul and the body the same thing, or they are different things?” 
^n379 “Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, reverend,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Take the case when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … 
 
They enter and remain in the first absorption … 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’?” 
“It would, reverend.” 
 
“But reverends, I know and see like this. 
Nevertheless, I do not say: 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’. … 
They enter and remain in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’?” 
“It would, reverend.” 
 
“But reverends, I know and see like this. 
Nevertheless, I do not say: 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’. … 
They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’?” 
“It would, reverend.” 
 
“But reverends, I know and see like this. 
Nevertheless, I do not say: 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’. … 
^n380 They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’?” 
“It would not, reverend.” 
 
“But reverends, I know and see like this. 
Nevertheless, I do not say: 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, the two renunciates were happy with what the Buddha said. 

^ck#d8(The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar )^n381 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuñña, in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala. 
Then the naked ascetic Kassapa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, I have heard the following: 
‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all forms of mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces those self-mortifiers who live rough.’
Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism? 
For we don’t want to misrepresent Master Gotama.” 
^n382 “Kassapa, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, baseless, and untrue. 
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see some self-mortifier who lives rough reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
But I see another self-mortifier who lives rough reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
^n383 I see some self-mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a place of loss. 
But I see another self-mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
Since I truly understand the coming and going, passing away and rebirth of these self-mortifiers in this way, how could I criticize all forms of mortification, or categorically condemn and denounce those self-mortifiers who live rough? 
^n384 There are some clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. 
They agree with me in some matters and disagree in others. 
Some of the things that they applaud, I also applaud. 
Some of the things that they don’t applaud, I also don’t applaud. 
But some of the things that they applaud, I don’t applaud. 
And some of the things that they don’t applaud, I do applaud. 
Some of the things that I applaud, others also applaud. 
Some of the things that I don’t applaud, they also don’t applaud. 
But some of the things that I don’t applaud, others do applaud. 
And some of the things that I do applaud, others don’t applaud. 
1. Examination ^n385 I go up to them and say: 
‘Let us leave aside those matters on which we disagree. 
But there are some matters on which we agree. Regarding these, sensible people, pursuing, pressing, and grilling, would compare teacher with teacher or community with community: 
“There are things that are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones, and dark—and are reckoned as such. 
Who behaves like they’ve totally given these things up: the ascetic Gotama, or the teachers of other communities?”’ 
^n386 It’s possible that they might say: 
 
‘The ascetic Gotama behaves like he’s totally given those unskillful things up, compared with the teachers of other communities.’ 
And that’s how, when sensible people pursue the matter, they will mostly praise us. 
^n387 In addition, sensible people, engaging, pressing, and grilling, would compare teacher with teacher or community with community: 
‘There are things that are skillful, blameless, worth cultivating, worthy of the noble ones, and bright—and are reckoned as such. 
Who proceeds having totally undertaken these things: the ascetic Gotama, or the teachers of other communities?’ 
^n388 It’s possible that they might say: 
 
‘The ascetic Gotama proceeds having totally undertaken these things, compared with the teachers of other communities.’ 
And that’s how, when sensible people pursue the matter, they will mostly praise us. 
^n389 In addition, sensible people, pursuing, pressing, and grilling, would compare teacher with teacher or community with community: 
‘There are things that are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones, and dark—and are reckoned as such. 
Who behaves like they’ve totally given these things up: the ascetic Gotama’s disciples, or the disciples of other teachers?’ 
^n390 It’s possible that they might say: 
 
‘The ascetic Gotama’s disciples behave like they’ve totally given those unskillful things up, compared with the disciples of other teachers.’ 
And that’s how, when sensible people pursue the matter, they will mostly praise us. 
^n391 In addition, sensible people, pursuing, pressing, and grilling, would compare teacher with teacher or community with community: 
‘There are things that are skillful, blameless, worth cultivating, worthy of the noble ones, and bright—and are reckoned as such. 
Who proceeds having totally undertaken these things: the ascetic Gotama’s disciples, or the disciples of other teachers?’ 
^n392 It’s possible that they might say: 
 
‘The ascetic Gotama’s disciples proceed having totally undertaken those skillful things, compared with the disciples of other teachers.’ 
And that’s how, when sensible people pursue the matter, they will mostly praise us. 
2. The Noble Eightfold Path ^n393 There is, Kassapa, a path, there is a practice, practicing in accordance with which you will know and see for yourself: 
‘Only the ascetic Gotama’s words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training.’
And what is that path? 
 
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
This is the path, this is the practice, practicing in accordance with which you will know and see for yourself: ‘Only the ascetic Gotama’s words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training.’” 
3. Practicing Self-Mortification ^n394 When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha: 
“Reverend Gotama, those ascetics and brahmins consider these practices of self-mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin. 
They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when asked. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal. 
They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer. 
They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. 
They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. 
They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals. 
^n395 Those ascetics and brahmins also consider these practices of self-mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin. 
They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. 
^n396 Those ascetics and brahmins also consider these practices of mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin. 
They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.
They tear out hair and beard, committed to this practice. 
They constantly stand, refusing seats. 
They squat, committed to persisting in the squatting position. 
They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. 
They make their bed on a plank, or the bare ground. 
They lie only on one side. 
They wear dust and dirt. 
They stay in the open air. 
They sleep wherever they lay their mat. 
They eat unnatural things, committed to the practice of eating unnatural foods. 
They don’t drink, committed to the practice of not drinking liquids. 
They’re committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening.” 
4. The Uselessness of Self-Mortification ^n397 “Kassapa, someone may practice all those forms of self-mortification, 
but if they haven’t developed and realized any accomplishment in ethics, mind, and wisdom, they are far from being a true ascetic or brahmin. 
But take a mendicant who develops a heart of love, free of enmity and ill will. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
When they achieve this, they’re called a mendicant who is a ‘true ascetic’ and also ‘a true brahmin’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
^n398 When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha, 
“It’s hard, Master Gotama, to be a true ascetic or a true brahmin.” 
“It’s typical, Kassapa, in this world to think that it’s hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin. 
But someone might practice all those forms of self-mortification. 
And if it was only because of just that much, only because of that self-mortification that it was so very hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin, it wouldn’t be appropriate to say that 
it’s hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin. 
For it would be quite possible for a householder or a householder’s child—or even the bonded maid who carries the water-jar—
to practice all those forms of self-mortification. 
It’s because there’s something other than just that much, something other than that self-mortification that it’s so very hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin. And that’s why it is appropriate to say that 
it’s hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin. 
Take a mendicant who develops a heart of love, free of enmity and ill will. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
When they achieve this, they’re called a mendicant who is a ‘true ascetic’ and also ‘a true brahmin’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
^n399 When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha, 
“It’s hard, Master Gotama, to know a true ascetic or a true brahmin.” 
“It’s typical in this world to think that it’s hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin. 
But someone might practice all those forms of self-mortification. 
And if it was only by just that much, only by that self-mortification that it was so very hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin, it wouldn’t be appropriate to say that 
it’s hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin. 
For it would be quite possible for a householder or a householder’s child—or even the bonded maid who carries the water-jar—
to know that someone is practicing all those forms of self-mortification. 
It’s because there’s something other than just that much, something other than that self-mortification that it’s so very hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin. And that’s why it is appropriate to say that 
it’s hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin. 
Take a mendicant who develops a heart of love, free of enmity and ill will. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
When they achieve this, they’re called a mendicant who is a ‘true ascetic’ and also ‘a true brahmin’.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. The Accomplishment of Ethics, Immersion, and Wisdom ^n400 When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha, 
“But Master Gotama, what is that accomplishment in ethics, in mind, and in wisdom?” 
“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … 
Seeing danger in the slightest fault, a mendicant keeps the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content. 
^n401 And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? 
It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. 
This pertains to their accomplishment in ethics. … 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still earn a living by unworthy branches of knowledge, by wrong livelihood. … 
 
They refrain from such unworthy branches of knowledge, such wrong livelihood. 
This pertains to their accomplishment in ethics. 
A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. 
It’s like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees no danger from his foes in any quarter. 
In the same way, a mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. 
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. 
This, Kassapa, is that accomplishment in ethics. … 
They enter and remain in the first absorption … 
This pertains to their accomplishment in mind. … 
They enter and remain in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
This pertains to their accomplishment in mind. 
This, Kassapa, is that accomplishment in mind. 
When their mind is immersed like this, 
they extend and project it toward knowledge and vision … 
This pertains to their accomplishment in wisdom. … 
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
This pertains to their accomplishment in wisdom. 
This, Kassapa, is that accomplishment in wisdom. 
And, Kassapa, there is no accomplishment in ethics, mind, and wisdom that is better or finer than this. 
6. The Lion’s Roar ^n402 There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach ethics. 
They praise ethical conduct in many ways. 
But as far as the highest noble ethics goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior. 
Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher ethics. 
There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin. 
They praise mortification in disgust of sin in many ways. 
But as far as the highest noble mortification in disgust of sin goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior. 
Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher mortification in disgust of sin. 
There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach wisdom. 
They praise wisdom in many ways. 
But as far as the highest noble wisdom goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior. 
Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher wisdom. 
There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach freedom. 
They praise freedom in many ways. 
But as far as the highest noble freedom goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior. 
Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher freedom. 
^n403 It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say: 
‘The ascetic Gotama only roars his lion’s roar in an empty hut, not in an assembly.’ 
They should be told, ‘Not so!’ 
What should be said is this: ‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and he roars it in the assemblies.’ 
It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say: 
‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and he roars it in the assemblies. But he doesn’t roar it boldly.’ 
They should be told, ‘Not so!’ 
What should be said is this: ‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, he roars it in the assemblies, and he roars it boldly.’ 
It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say: 
‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, he roars it in the assemblies, and he roars it boldly. But they don’t question him. … 
Or he doesn’t answer their questions. … 
Or his answers are not satisfactory. … 
Or they don’t think him worth listening to. … 
Or they’re not confident after listening. … 
Or they don’t show their confidence. … 
Or they don’t practice accordingly. … 
Or they don’t succeed in their practice.’ 
They should be told, ‘Not so!’ 
What should be said is this: ‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar; he roars it in the assemblies; he roars it boldly; they question him; he answers their questions; his answers are satisfactory; they think him worth listening to; they’re confident after listening; they show their confidence; they practice accordingly; and they succeed in their practice.’ 
7. The Probation For One Previously Ordained ^n404 Kassapa, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
There a certain practitioner of self-mortification named Nigrodha asked me about the higher mortification in disgust of sin. 
I answered his question. 
He was extremely happy with my answer.” 
“Sir, who wouldn’t be extremely happy after hearing the Buddha’s teaching? 
For I too am extremely happy after hearing the Buddha’s teaching! 
Excellent, sir! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
^n405 “Kassapa, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. 
However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.” 
“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” 
And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected. 

^ck#d9(With Poṭṭhapāda )1. On the Wanderer Poṭṭhapāda ^n406 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was residing together with three hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for group debates, set among the flaking pale-moon ebony trees.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
^n407 Then it occurred to him, 
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. 
Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?” 
So that’s what he did. 
^n408 Now at that time, Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as 
talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. 
^n409 Poṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, 
and hushed his own assembly, 
“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. 
Here comes the ascetic Gotama. 
The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet. 
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” 
Then those wanderers fell silent. 
^n410 Then the Buddha approached Poṭṭhapāda, 
who said to him, 
“Come, Blessed One! 
Welcome, Blessed One! 
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. 
Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” 
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, 
while Poṭṭhapāda took a low seat and sat to one side. 
The Buddha said to him, 
“Poṭṭhapāda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?” 
1.1. On the Cessation of Perception ^n411 When he said this, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now. 
It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later. 
Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths were sitting together at the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them: 
‘How does the cessation of perception happen?’
Some of them said: 
‘A person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason. 
When they arise, you become percipient. 
When they cease, you become non-percipient.’ 
That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. 
But someone else says: 
‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen !
Perception is a person’s self, 
 
When it enters, you become percipient. 
When it departs, you become non-percipient.’ 
That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. 
But someone else says: 
‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen ! 
There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and might. 
They insert and extract a person’s perception.
When they insert it, you become percipient. 
When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ 
That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. 
But someone else says: 
‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen ! 
There are deities of great power and might. 
They insert and extract a person’s perception. 
When they insert it, you become percipient. 
When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ 
That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. 
That reminded me of the Buddha: 
‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters.’ 
The Buddha is skilled and well-versed in the cessation of perception.
How does the cessation of perception happen?” 
1.2. Perception Arises With a Cause ^n412 “Regarding this, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and brahmins who say that 
a person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the start. 
Why is that? 
Because a person’s perceptions arise and cease with cause and reason. 
With training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. 
^n413 And what is that training?” said the Buddha. 
“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … 
Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. 
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
The sensual perception that they had previously ceases. 
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion. 
That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. 
And this is that training,” said the Buddha. 
“Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion that they had previously ceases. 
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. 
And this is that training,” said the Buddha. 
“Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion that they had previously ceases. 
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss. 
That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. 
And this is that training,” said the Buddha. 
“Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
The subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss that they had previously ceases. 
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of neutral feeling. 
That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. 
And this is that training,” said the Buddha. 
“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. 
The perception of luminous form that they had previously ceases. 
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space. 
That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. 
And this is that training,” said the Buddha. 
“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. 
The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space that they had previously ceases. 
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness. 
That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. 
And this is that training,” said the Buddha. 
“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. 
The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness that they had previously ceases. 
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of nothingness. 
That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. 
And this is that training,” said the Buddha. 
^n414 “Poṭṭhapāda, from the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception, they proceed from one stage to the next, gradually reaching the peak of perception.
Standing on the peak of perception they think, 
‘Intentionality is bad for me, it’s better to be free of it. 
For if I were to intend and choose, these perceptions would cease in me, and other coarser perceptions would arise. 
Why don’t I neither make a choice nor form an intention?’ 
They neither make a choice nor form an intention. 
Those perceptions cease in them, and other coarser perceptions don’t arise. 
They touch cessation. 
And that, Poṭṭhapāda, is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awareness. 
What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? 
Have you ever heard of this before?” 
“No, sir. 
This is how I understand what the Buddha said: 
‘From the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception, they proceed from one stage to the next, gradually reaching the peak of perception. 
Standing on the peak of perception they think, 
“Intentionality is bad for me, it’s better to be free of it. 
For if I were to intend and choose, these perceptions would cease in me, and other coarser perceptions would arise. 
Why don’t I neither make a choice nor form an intention?” 
Those perceptions cease in them, and other coarser perceptions don’t arise. 
They touch cessation. 
And that is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awareness.’” 
“That’s right, Poṭṭhapāda.” 
^n415 “Does the Buddha describe just one peak of perception, or many?” 
“I describe the peak of perception as both one and many.” 
“But sir, how do you describe it as one peak and as many?” 
“I describe the peak of perception according to the specific manner in which one touches cessation. 
That’s how I describe the peak of perception as both one and many.” 
^n416 “But sir, does perception arise first and knowledge afterwards? Or does knowledge arise first and perception afterwards? Or do they both arise at the same time?” 
“Perception arises first and knowledge afterwards. The arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge. 
They understand, 
‘My knowledge arose from a specific condition.’ 
That is a way to understand how 
perception arises first and knowledge afterwards; that the arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge.” 
1.3. Perception and the Self ^n417 “Sir, is perception a person’s self, or are perception and self different things?” 
“But Poṭṭhapāda, do you believe in a self?” 
“I believe in a substantial self, sir, which is physical, made up of the four primary elements, and consumes solid food.” 
“Suppose there were such a substantial self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. 
Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. 
So long as that substantial self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease.
That is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” 
^n418 “Sir, I believe in a mind-made self which is complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty.”
“Suppose there were such a mind-made self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. 
Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. 
So long as that mind-made self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease. 
That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” 
^n419 “Sir, I believe in a non-physical self which is made of perception.” 
“Suppose there were such a non-physical self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. 
Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. 
So long as that non-physical self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease. 
That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” 
^n420 “But, sir, am I able to know whether 
perception is a person’s self, or whether perception and self are different things?” 
“It’s hard for you to understand this, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition.” 
 
“Well, if that’s the case, sir, 
 
then is this right: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?” 
“This has not been declared by me, Poṭṭhapāda.” 
 
“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?” 
“This too has not been declared by me.” 
 
“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is finite …’ … 
‘The cosmos is infinite …’ … 
‘The soul and the body are the same thing …’ … 
‘The soul and the body are different things …’ … 
‘A Realized One exists after death …’ … 
‘A Realized One doesn’t exist after death …’ … 
‘A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death …’ … 
‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?” 
“This too has not been declared by me.” 
 
“Why haven’t these things been declared by the Buddha?” 
“Because they’re not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
That’s why I haven’t declared them.” 
“Then what has been declared by the Buddha?” 
“I have declared this: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.” 
“Why have these things been declared by the Buddha?” 
“Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
That’s why I have declared them.” 
“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
Please, sir, go at your convenience.” 
Then the Buddha got up from his seat and left. 
^n421 Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers gave Poṭṭhapāda a comprehensive tongue-lashing, 
“No matter what the ascetic Gotama says, Poṭṭhapāda agrees with him: 
‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!’ 
We understand that the ascetic Gotama didn’t make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on.” 
 
When they said this, Poṭṭhapāda said to them, 
“I too understand that the ascetic Gotama didn’t make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on. 
 
 
Nevertheless, the practice that he describes is true, real, and accurate. It is the regularity of natural principles, the invariance of natural principles. 
So how could a sensible person such as I not agree that what was well spoken by the ascetic Gotama was in fact well spoken?” 
2. On Citta Hatthisāriputta ^n422 Then after two or three days had passed, Citta Hatthisāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda went to see the Buddha. Citta Hatthisāriputta bowed and sat down to one side.
But the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. 
Poṭṭhapāda told the Buddha what had happened after he left. The Buddha said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
^n423 “All those wanderers, Poṭṭhapāda, are blind and sightless. 
You are the only one who sees. 
For I have taught and pointed out both things that are definitive 
and things that are not definitive. 
And what things have I taught and pointed out that are not definitive? 
‘The cosmos is eternal’ … 
‘The cosmos is not eternal’ … 
‘The cosmos is finite’ … 
‘The cosmos is infinite’ … 
‘The soul is the same thing as the body’ … 
‘The soul and the body are different things’ … 
‘A Realized One exists after death’ … 
‘A Realized One doesn’t exist after death’ … 
‘A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death’ … 
‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ 
And why haven’t I taught and pointed out such things that are not definitive? 
Because those things aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
That’s why I haven’t taught and pointed them out. 
2.1. Things That Are Definitive ^n424 And what things have I taught and pointed out that are definitive? 
‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.” 
 
 
 
And why have I taught and pointed out such things that are definitive? 
Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
That’s why I have taught and pointed them out. 
^n425 There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: 
‘The self is exclusively happy and is sound after death.’ 
I go up to them and say, 
‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’ 
 
And they answer, ‘Yes’. 
I say to them, 
‘But do you meditate knowing and seeing an exclusively happy world?’ 
Asked this, they say, ‘No.’ 
I say to them, 
‘But have you perceived an exclusively happy self for a single day or night, or even half a day or night?’ 
Asked this, they say, ‘No.’ 
I say to them, 
‘But do you know 
a path and a practice to realize an exclusively happy world?’ 
Asked this, they say, ‘No.’ 
I say to them, 
‘But have you ever heard the voice of the deities reborn in an exclusively happy world saying, 
“Practice well, dear sirs, practice directly so as to realize an exclusively happy world. 
For this is how we practiced, and we were reborn in an exclusively happy world”?’ 
Asked this, they say, ‘No.’ 
What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? 
This being so, doesn’t what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
^n426 “Suppose, Poṭṭhapāda, a man were to say: 
‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her that I desire!’ 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know her name or clan? Whether she’s tall or short or medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or tawny? What village, town, or city she comes from?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, do you desire someone who you’ve never even known or seen?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’ 
What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? 
This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
“In the same way, the ascetics and brahmins who have those various doctrines and views … 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Doesn’t what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
^n427 “Suppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to a stilt longhouse.
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, that stilt longhouse that you’re building a ladder for—do you know whether it’s to the north, south, east, or west? Or whether it’s tall or short or medium?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, are you building a ladder for a longhouse that you’ve never even known or seen?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’ 
What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? 
This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
“In the same way, the ascetics and brahmins who have those various doctrines and views … 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Doesn’t what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
2.2. Three Kinds of Reincarnation ^n428 “Poṭṭhapāda, there are these three kinds of reincarnation:
a substantial reincarnation, a mind-made reincarnation, and a non-physical reincarnation. 
And what is a substantial reincarnation? 
It is physical, made up of the four primary elements, and consumes solid food. 
What is a mind-made reincarnation? 
It is physical, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. 
What is a non-physical reincarnation? 
It is non-physical, made of perception. 
^n429 I teach the Dhamma for the giving up of these three kinds of reincarnation: 
‘When you practice accordingly, corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow. You’ll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with your own insight in this very life.’ 
Poṭṭhapāda, you might think: 
‘Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow. One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with one’s own insight in this very life. But such a life is suffering.’
But you should not see it like this. 
Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow. One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with one’s own insight in this very life. And there will be only joy and happiness, tranquility, mindfulness and awareness. Such a life is blissful. 
^n430  
 
 
 
 
 
^n431  
 
 
 
 
 
^n432 If others should ask us, 
‘But reverends, what is that substantial reincarnation?’ We’d answer like this, 
‘This is that substantial reincarnation.’ 
^n433 If others should ask us, 
‘But reverends, what is that mind-made reincarnation?’ We’d answer like this, 
 
‘This is that mind-made reincarnation.’ 
^n434 If others should ask us, 
‘But reverends, what is that non-physical reincarnation?’ We’d answer like this, 
 
‘This is that non-physical reincarnation.’ 
What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda?
This being so, doesn’t that statement turn out to have a demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
^n435 “Suppose a man were to build a ladder for climbing up to a stilt longhouse right underneath that longhouse. 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, that stilt longhouse that you’re building a ladder for—do you know whether it’s to the north, south, east, or west? Or whether it’s tall or short or medium?’ 
He’d say, 
‘This is that stilt longhouse for which I’m building a ladder, right underneath it.’ 
What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? 
This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have a demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
^n436  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
^n437 When the Buddha had spoken, Citta Hatthisāriputta said, 
“Sir, while in a substantial reincarnation, are the mind-made and non-physical reincarnations fictitious, 
and only the substantial reincarnation real? 
While in a mind-made reincarnation, are the substantial and non-physical reincarnations fictitious, 
and only the mind-made reincarnation real? 
While in a non-physical reincarnation, are the substantial and mind-made reincarnations fictitious, 
and only the non-physical reincarnation real?” 
“While in a substantial reincarnation, it’s not referred to as a mind-made or non-physical reincarnation, 
only as a substantial reincarnation. 
While in a mind-made reincarnation, it’s not referred to as a substantial or non-physical reincarnation, 
only as a mind-made reincarnation. 
While in a non-physical reincarnation, it’s not referred to as a substantial or mind-made reincarnation, 
only as a non-physical reincarnation. 
^n438 Citta, suppose they were to ask you, 
‘Did you exist in the past? 
Will you exist in the future? 
Do you exist now?’ 
How would you answer?” 
“Sir, if they were to ask me this, 
 
 
 
I’d answer like this, 
‘I existed in the past. 
I will exist in the future. 
I exist now.’ 
That’s how I’d answer.” 
“But Citta, suppose they were to ask you, 
‘Is the reincarnation you had in the past your only real one, and those of the future and present fictitious? 
Is the reincarnation you will have in the future your only real one, and those of the past and present fictitious? 
Is the reincarnation you have now your only real one, and those of the past and future fictitious?’ 
How would you answer?” 
“Sir, if they were to ask me this, 
 
 
 
I’d answer like this, 
‘The reincarnation I had in the past was real at that time, and those of the future and present fictitious. 
The reincarnation I will have in the future will be real at the time, and those of the past and present fictitious. 
The reincarnation I have now is real at this time, and those of the past and future fictitious.’ 
That’s how I’d answer.” 
^n439 “In the same way, while in any one of the three reincarnations, it’s not referred to as the other two, only under its own name. 
 
 
 
 
^n440 From a cow comes milk, from milk comes curds, from curds come butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream of ghee. And the cream of ghee is said to be the best of these. 
While it’s milk, it’s not referred to as curds, butter, ghee, or cream of ghee. 
It’s only referred to as milk. 
While it’s curd 
or butter 
or ghee 
or cream of ghee, it’s not referred to as anything else, 
only under its own name. 
In the same way, while in any one of the three reincarnations, it’s not referred to as the other two, only under its own name. 
 
 
 
These are the world’s usages, terms, expressions, and descriptions, which the Realized One uses without misapprehending them.” 
^n441 When he had spoken, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
2.3. The Ordination of Citta Hatthisāriputta ^n442 But Citta Hatthisāriputta said to the Buddha, 
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
^n443 And Citta Hatthisāriputta received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected.

^ck#d10(With Subha )^n444 So I have heard. 
At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully extinguished. 
Now at that time the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was residing in Sāvatthī on some business. 
^n445 Then he addressed a certain student, 
“Here, student, go to the ascetic Ānanda and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. 
 
And then say: 
‘Sir, please visit the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, at his home out of compassion.’” 
^n446 “Yes, sir,” replied the student, and did as he was asked. 
 
 
 
 
^n447 When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to him, 
“It’s not the right time, student. 
I’ve drunk sufficient refreshments for today. 
But hopefully tomorrow I’ll get a chance to visit him.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied the student. He went back to Subha, and told him what had happened, adding, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“This much, sir, I managed to do. At least Master Ānanda will take the opportunity to visit tomorrow.” 
^n448 Then when the night had passed, Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Cetaka as his second monk to Subha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out.
Then Subha went up to Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda: 
“Master Ānanda, you were Master Gotama’s attendant. You were close to him, living in his presence. 
You ought to know what things Master Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people. 
What were those things?” 
^n449 “Student, the Buddha praised three sets of things, and that’s what he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people in. 
What three? 
The entire spectrum of noble ethics, immersion, and wisdom. 
These are the three sets of things that the Buddha praised.” 
1. The Entire Spectrum of Ethics ^n450 “But what was that noble spectrum of ethics that the Buddha praised?” 
“Student, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some clan. 
They gain faith in the Realized One, 
and reflect: 
‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. 
It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. 
Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ 
After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content. 
^n451 And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? 
It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. … 
 
This pertains to their ethics. 
There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still earn a living by unworthy branches of knowledge, by wrong livelihood. 
This includes rites for propitiation, for granting wishes, for ghosts, for the earth, for rain, for property settlement, and for preparing and consecrating house sites, and rites involving rinsing and bathing, and oblations. It also includes administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants, and phlegmagogues; administering ear-oils, eye restoratives, nasal medicine, ointments, and counter-ointments; surgery with needle and scalpel, treating children, prescribing root medicines, and binding on herbs. 
They refrain from such unworthy branches of knowledge, such wrong livelihood. … 
 
 
 
This pertains to their ethics. 
^n452 A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. 
It’s like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees no danger from his foes in any quarter. 
A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. 
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. 
^n453 This is that noble spectrum of ethics that the Buddha praised. 
But there is still more to be done.” 
“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing, 
This noble spectrum of ethics is complete, not lacking anything! 
Such a complete spectrum of ethics cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahmins. 
Were other ascetics and brahmins to see such a complete spectrum of noble ethics in themselves, they’d be delighted with just that much: 
‘At this point it’s enough; at this point our work is done. We’ve reached the goal of our ascetic life. There is nothing more to be done.’ 
And yet you say: 
‘But there is still more to be done.’ 
2. The Spectrum of Immersion ^n454 But what, Master Ānanda, was that noble spectrum of immersion that the Buddha praised?” 
“And how, student, does a mendicant guard the sense doors? 
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. 
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. 
When they hear a sound with their ears … 
When they smell an odor with their nose … 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue … 
When they feel a touch with their body … 
When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. 
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. 
When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves. 
That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors. 
^n455 And how does a mendicant have mindfulness and situational awareness? 
It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. 
That’s how a mendicant has mindfulness and situational awareness. 
^n456 And how is a mendicant content? 
It’s when a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. 
They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. 
In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. 
That’s how a mendicant is content. 
^n457 When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, and this noble contentment, 
they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. 
After the meal, they return from alms-round, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. 
^n458 Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. 
Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. 
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. 
Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. 
Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. 
^n459 Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work, 
and his efforts proved successful. 
He would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partner. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
 
he’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n460 Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill. They’d lose their appetite and get physically weak. 
But after some time they’d recover from that illness, and regain their appetite and their strength. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
they’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n461 Suppose a person was imprisoned in a jail. 
But after some time they were released from jail, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
they’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n462 Suppose a person was a bondservant. They belonged to someone else and were unable to go where they wish. 
But after some time they’d be freed from servitude and become their own master, an emancipated individual able to go where they wish. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
they’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n463 Suppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road, which was perilous, with nothing to eat. 
But after some time they crossed over the desert safely, reaching the neighborhood of a village, a sanctuary free of peril. 
Thinking about this, 
 
 
they’d be filled with joy and happiness. 
^n464 In the same way, as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards them as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing. 
^n465 But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and sanctuary. 
 
^n466 Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. 
^n467 Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. 
It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. 
 
 
This pertains to their immersion. 
^n468 Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. 
 
 
This pertains to their immersion. 
^n469 Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. 
It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water. 
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. 
 
 
This pertains to their immersion. 
^n470 Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. 
There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. 
It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth. 
In the same way, a mendicant sits spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There's no part of their body that's not spread with pure bright mind. 
 
 
This pertains to their immersion. 
^n471 This is that noble spectrum of immersion that the Buddha praised. 
But there is still more to be done.” 
“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing! 
This noble spectrum of immersion is complete, not lacking anything! 
Such a complete spectrum of immersion cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahmins. 
Were other ascetics and brahmins to see such a complete spectrum of noble immersion in themselves, they’d be delighted with just that much: 
‘At this point it’s enough; at this point our work is done. We’ve reached the goal of our ascetic life. There is nothing more to be done.’ 
And yet you say: 
‘But there is still more to be done.’ 
3. The Spectrum of Wisdom ^n472 But what, Master Ānanda, was that noble spectrum of wisdom that the Buddha praised?” 
“When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. 
They understand: 
‘This body of mine is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’ 
Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown. 
And someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and examine it: ‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
^n473 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward the creation of a mind-made body. 
From this body they create another body, physical, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. 
Suppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheath. 
They’d think: 
‘This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed and the sheath are different things. The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’ 
Or suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbard. 
They’d think: 
‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword and the scabbard are different things. The sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’ 
Or suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its slough. 
They’d think: 
‘This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake and the slough are different things. The snake has been drawn out from the slough.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward the creation of a mind-made body. 
 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
^n474 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward psychic power. 
They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. 
Suppose an expert potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay. They could produce any kind of pot that they like. 
Or suppose an expert ivory-carver or their apprentice had some well-prepared ivory. They could produce any kind of ivory item that they like. 
Or suppose an expert goldsmith or their apprentice had some well-prepared gold. They could produce any kind of gold item that they like. 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward psychic power. 
 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
^n475 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward clairaudience. 
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. 
Suppose there was a person traveling along the road. They’d hear the sound of drums, clay drums, horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms. They’d think: ‘That’s the sound of drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of clay-drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward clairaudience. 
 
 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
^n476 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of others. 
They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … immersed mind … unimmersed mind … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’. 
Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they had a spot they’d know ‘I have a spot,’ and if they had no spots they’d know ‘I have no spots.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of others. 
 
 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
^n477 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward recollection of past lives. 
They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. Passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there I had such a name, such a family, such appearance, such food, such experience of happiness and suffering, and such a life-span. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward recollection of past lives. 
 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
^n478 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. 
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. 
Suppose there was a stilt longhouse at the central square. A person with good eyesight standing there might see people entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square. They’d think: ‘These are people entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. 
 
 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
^n479 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. 
They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. 
Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. 
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still. They’d think: ‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’ 
In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. 
 
 
 
 
This pertains to their wisdom. 
^n480 This is that noble spectrum of wisdom that the Buddha praised. 
And there is nothing more to be done.” 
“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing! 
This noble spectrum of wisdom is complete, not lacking anything! 
Such a complete spectrum of wisdom cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahmins. 
And there is nothing more to be done. 
Excellent, Master Ānanda! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

^ck#d11(With Kevaddha )^n481 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. 
Then the householder Kevaddha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, this Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous and full of people. 
Sir, please direct a mendicant to perform a demonstration of superhuman psychic power. 
Then Nāḷandā will become even more devoted to the Buddha!” 
When he said this, The Buddha said, 
“Kevaddha, I do not teach the mendicants like this: 
‘Come now, mendicants, perform a demonstration of superhuman psychic power for the white-clothed laypeople.’” 
^n482 For a second time, Kevaddha made the same request, 
 
 
 
 
 
and the Buddha gave the same answer. 
 
 
For a third time, Kevaddha made the same request, 
 
 
 
 
and the Buddha said the following. 
1. The Demonstration of Psychic Power ^n483 “Kevaddha, there are three kinds of demonstration, which I declare having realized them with my own insight. 
What three? 
The demonstration of psychic power, the demonstration of revealing, and the demonstration of instruction. 
^n484 And what is the demonstration of psychic power? 
It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. 
Then someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant performing those superhuman feats. 
They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence: 
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might! 
I saw him myself, performing all these superhuman feats!’ 
But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them: 
‘There’s a spell named Gandhārī. 
Using that a mendicant can perform such superhuman feats.’ 
What do you think, Kevaddha? 
Wouldn’t someone lacking faith speak like that?” 
“They would, sir.” 
“Seeing this drawback in psychic power, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by demonstrations of psychic power. 
2. The Demonstration of Revealing ^n485 And what is the demonstration of revealing? 
In one case, someone reveals the mind, mentality, thoughts, and reflections of other beings and individuals: 
‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ 
Then someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant revealing another person’s thoughts. 
 
They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence: 
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might! 
I saw him myself, revealing the thoughts of another person!’ 
 
But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them: 
‘There’s a spell named Māṇikā. 
Using that a mendicant can reveal another person’s thoughts.’ 
 
What do you think, Kevaddha? 
Wouldn’t someone lacking faith speak like that?” 
“They would, sir.” 
“Seeing this drawback in psychic power, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by demonstrations of psychic power. 
3. The Demonstration of Instruction ^n486 And what is the demonstration of instruction? 
It’s when a mendicant instructs others like this: 
‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’ 
This is called the demonstration of instruction. 
Furthermore, a Realized One arises in the world … 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … 
They enter and remain in the first absorption … 
This is called the demonstration of instruction. 
They enter and remain in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
This too is called the demonstration of instruction. 
They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … 
This too is called the demonstration of instruction. 
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
This too is called the demonstration of instruction. 
These, Kevaddha, are the three kinds of demonstration, which I declare having realized them with my own insight. 
4. On the Mendicant In Search of the Cessation of Being ^n487 Once it so happened, Kevaddha, that a mendicant in this very Saṅgha had the following thought, 
‘Where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ 
^n488 Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to the gods appeared. 
Then he approached the Gods of the Four Great Kings and said, 
‘Reverends, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ 
When he said this, those gods said to him, 
‘Mendicant, we too do not know this. 
 
But the Four Great Kings are our superiors. 
They might know.’ 
 
^n489 Then he approached the Four Great Kings and asked the same question. 
 
But they also said to him, 
‘Mendicant, we too do not know this. 
 
But the gods of the Thirty-Three … 
 
 
^n490  
 
 
 
 
Sakka, lord of gods … 
 
 
^n491  
 
 
 
 
the gods of Yāmā … 
the god named Suyāma … 
the Joyful gods … 
the god named Santussita … 
the gods who delight in creation … 
the god named Sunimmita … 
the gods who control the creation of others … 
the god named Vasavattī … 
 
 
^n492  
 
 
 
 
the gods of Brahmā’s Host. 
They might know.’ 
 
^n493 Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to Brahmā appeared. 
Then he approached those gods and said, 
‘Reverends, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ 
But they also said to him, 
‘Mendicant, we too do not know this. 
 
But there is Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. He is our superior. 
He might know.’ 
 
‘But reverends, where is that Brahmā now?’ 
‘We also don’t know where he is or what way he lies. 
But by the signs that are seen—light arising and radiance appearing—we know that Brahmā will appear. For this is the precursor for the appearance of Brahmā, namely light arising and radiance appearing.’ 
Not long afterwards, the Great Brahmā appeared. 
^n494 Then that mendicant approached the Great Brahmā and said to him, 
‘Reverend, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ 
The Great Brahmā said to him, 
‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.’ 
For a second time, that mendicant said to the Great Brahmā, 
‘Reverend, I am not asking you whether you are 
Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. 
I am asking 
where these four primary elements cease without anything left over.’ 
For a second time, the Great Brahmā said to him, 
‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.’ 
For a third time, that mendicant said to the Great Brahmā, 
‘Reverend, I am not asking you whether you are 
Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the Best, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. 
I am asking 
where these four primary elements cease without anything left over.’ 
^n495 Then the Great Brahmā took that mendicant by the arm, led him off to one side, and said to him, 
‘Mendicant, these gods think that there is nothing at all that I don’t know and see and understand and realize. 
That’s why I didn’t answer in front of them. 
But I too do not know where these four primary elements cease with nothing left over. 
Therefore, mendicant, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone, in that you passed over the Buddha and searched elsewhere for an answer to this question. 
Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him this question. You should remember it in line with his answer.’ 
^n496 Then that mendicant, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me. 
Then he bowed, sat down to one side, and said to me, 
‘Sir, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ 
4.1. The Simile of the Land-Spotting Bird ^n497 When he said this, I said to him: 
‘Once upon a time, mendicant, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird. 
When their ship was out of sight of land, they released the bird. 
It flew right away to the east, the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between. 
If it saw land on any side, it went there and stayed. 
But if it saw no land on any side it returned to the ship. 
In the same way, after failing to get an answer to this question even after searching as far as the Brahmā realm, you’ve returned to me. 
Mendicant, this is not how the question should be asked: 
“Sir, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?” 
^n498 This is how the question should be asked: 
“Where do water and earth, 
fire and air find no footing; 
where do long and short, 
fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly; 
where do name and form 
cease with nothing left over?” 
^n499 And the answer to that is: 
“Consciousness that’s invisible, 
infinite, entirely given up:
that’s where water and earth, 
fire and air find no footing; 
and that’s where long and short, 
fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly,
that’s where name and form 
cease with nothing left over—
with the cessation of consciousness, 
that’s where this ceases.”’” 
^n500 That is what the Buddha said. 
Satisfied, the householder Kevaddha was happy with what the Buddha said. 

^ck#d12(With Lohicca )^n501 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Sālavatikā. 
Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. 
^n502 Now at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconception: 
“Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? 
Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. 
That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?” 
^n503 Lohicca heard: 
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Sālavatikā, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
^n504 Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika,
“Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. 
 
And then ask him whether he, 
together with the mendicant Saṅgha, might accept tomorrow’s meal from the brahmin Lohicca.”
^n505 “Yes, sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked, and 
 
 
 
the Buddha consented in silence. 
^n506 Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Rosika got up from his seat, went to Lohicca, and said to him, 
“I gave the Buddha your message, 
 
 
 
and he accepted.” 
^n507 And when the night had passed Lohicca had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, 
“Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time, saying: 
‘Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.’” 
“Yes, sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked. 
 
 
^n508 Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. 
Now, Rosika was following behind the Buddha, 
and told him of Lohicca’s views, adding, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Sir, please dissuade him from that harmful misconception.” 
“Hopefully that’ll happen, Rosika, hopefully that’ll happen.” 
Then the Buddha approached Lohicca’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
Then Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. 
1. Questioning Lohicca ^n509 When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Lohicca took a low seat and sat to one side. 
The Buddha said to him, 
“Is it really true, Lohicca, that you have such a harmful misconception: 
‘Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? 
Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. 
That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’” 
“Yes, Master Gotama.” 
“What do you think, Lohicca? 
Do you reside in Sālavatikā?” 
“Yes, Master Gotama.” 
“Lohicca, suppose someone were to say: 
‘The brahmin Lohicca reigns over Sālavatikā. 
He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Sālavatikā and not share them with anyone else.’ 
Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for those whose living depends on you or not?” 
“They would, Master Gotama.” 
“But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly?” 
“Unkindly, sir.” 
“But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility?” 
“Hostility, sir.” 
“And when the heart is full of hostility, is there right view or wrong view?” 
“Wrong view, Master Gotama.” 
“An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: 
hell or the animal realm. 
^n510 What do you think, Lohicca? 
Does King Pasenadi reign over Kāsī and Kosala?” 
“Yes, Master Gotama.” 
“Lohicca, suppose someone were to say: 
‘King Pasenadi reigns over Kāsī and Kosala. 
He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Kāsī and Kosala and not share them with anyone else.’ 
Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for yourself and others whose living depends on King Pasenadi or not?” 
“They would, Master Gotama.” 
“But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly?” 
“Unkindly, sir.” 
“But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility?” 
“Hostility, sir.” 
“And when the heart is full of hostility, is there right view or wrong view?” 
“Wrong view, Master Gotama.” 
“An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: 
hell or the animal realm. 
^n511 So it seems, Lohicca, that should someone say such a thing either of Lohicca or of King Pasenadi, 
 
 
 
that is wrong view. 
In the same way, suppose someone were to say: 
‘Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? 
Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. 
That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’ 
Now, there are gentlemen who, relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, achieve a high distinction such as the following: they realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-return, the fruit of non-return, or the fruit of perfection. And in addition, there are those who ripen the seeds for rebirth in a heavenly state. The person who spoke like that makes it difficult for them. They’re acting unkindly, their heart is full of hostility, and they have wrong view. 
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: 
hell or the animal realm. 
^n512  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Three Teachers Who Deserve to Be Reprimanded ^n513 Lohicca, there are three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded. 
When someone reprimands such teachers, the reprimand is true, substantive, legitimate, and blameless. 
What three? 
Firstly, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
They teach their disciples: 
‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ 
But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand. They proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. 
That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: 
‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples 
 
they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. 
It’s like a man who makes advances on a woman though she pulls away, or embraces her though she turns her back. 
That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one do for another?’ 
 
This is the first kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. 
 
^n514 Furthermore, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
They teach their disciples: 
‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ 
Their disciples do want to listen. They pay attention and apply their minds to understand. They don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.
That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: 
‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples 
 
they don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. 
It’s like someone who abandons their own field and presumes to weed someone else’s field. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one do for another?’ 
This is the second kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. 
 
^n515 Furthermore, take a teacher who has reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
They teach their disciples: 
‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ 
But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand. They proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. 
That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: 
‘Venerable, you have reached the goal of the ascetic life; yet when you teach disciples 
 
 
they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. 
Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. 
That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’ 
This is the third kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. 
 
These are the three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded. 
When someone reprimands such teachers, the reprimand is true, substantive, legitimate, and blameless.” 
3. A Teacher Who Does Not Deserve to Be Reprimanded ^n516 When he had spoken, Lohicca said to the Buddha, 
“But Master Gotama, is there a teacher in the world who does not deserve to be reprimanded?” 
“There is, Lohicca.” 
“But who is that teacher?” 
“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … 
They enter and remain in the first absorption … 
A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. 
When someone reprimands such a teacher, the reprimand is false, baseless, illegitimate, and blameworthy. 
 
They enter and remain in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. … 
 
They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … 
A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. … 
 
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. When someone reprimands such a teacher, the reprimand is false, baseless, illegitimate, and blameworthy.” 
^n517 When he had spoken, Lohicca said to the Buddha: 
“Suppose, Master Gotama, a person was on the verge of falling off a cliff, and another person were to grab them by the hair, pull them up, and place them on firm ground.
In the same way, when I was falling off a cliff Master Gotama pulled me up and placed me on safe ground. 
Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

^ck#d13(The Three Knowledges )^n518 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Manasākaṭa. 
He stayed in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa. 
^n519 Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa. They included 
the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. 
^n520 Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding the variety of paths. 
Vāseṭṭha said this: 
“This is the only straight path, the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā; namely, that explained by the brahmin Pokkharasāti.”
Bhāradvāja said this: 
“This is the only straight path, the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā; namely, that explained by the brahmin Tārukkha.” 
But neither was able to persuade the other. 
^n521 So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, 
“Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa. 
He has this good reputation: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. 
As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. 
1. The Variety of Paths ^n522 So they went to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation, adding: 
 
 
 
 
 
“In this matter we have a dispute, a disagreement, a difference of opinion.” 
^n523 “So, Vāseṭṭha, it seems that you say that 
the straight path is that explained by Pokkharasāti, 
while Bhāradvāja says that 
the straight path is that explained by Tārukkha. 
But what exactly is your disagreement about?” 
^n524 “About the variety of paths, Master Gotama. 
Even though brahmins describe different paths—the Addhariya brahmins, the Tittiriya brahmins, the Chandoka brahmins, and the Bavhadija brahmins—all of them lead someone who practices them to the company of Brahmā.
It’s like a village or town that has many different roads nearby, yet all of them meet at that village. 
In the same way, even though brahmins describe different paths—the Addhariya brahmins, the Tittiriya brahmins, the Chandoka brahmins, and the Bavhadija brahmins—all of them lead someone who practices them to the company of Brahmā.” 
2. Questioning Vāseṭṭha ^n525 “Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?” 
“I do, Master Gotama.” 
“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?” 
“I do, Master Gotama.” 
“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?” 
“I do, Master Gotama.” 
“Well, of the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas, Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single one who has seen Brahmā with their own eyes?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“Well, has even a single one of their teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“Well, has even a single one of their teachers’ teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“Well, has anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
^n526 “Well, what of the ancient hermits of the brahmins, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught. 
Did they say: 
‘We know and see where Brahmā is or what way he lies’?”
“No, Master Gotama.” 
^n527 “So it seems that none of the brahmins have seen Brahmā with their own eyes, 
 
 
 
and not even the ancient hermits 
claimed to know where he is. 
Yet the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas say: 
‘We teach the path to the company of that which we neither know nor see. 
This is the only straight path, the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā.’ 
^n528 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
This being so, doesn’t their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, Master Gotama.” 
“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see. 
^n529 Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. 
In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. 
Their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, void and hollow. 
^n530 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Do the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other folk do? And do they pray to them and beseech them, following their course from where they rise to where they set with joined palms held in worship?” 
“Yes, Master Gotama.” 
^n531 “What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Though this is so, are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon, saying: 
‘This is the only straight path, the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of the sun and moon’?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“So it seems that even though the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon, they are not able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon. 
 
^n532 But it seems that even though they have not seen Brahmā with their own eyes, 
 
 
 
 
 
they still claim 
to teach the path to the company of that which they neither know nor see. 
^n533 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
This being so, doesn’t their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, Master Gotama.” 
“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see. 
2.1. The Simile of the Finest Lady in the Land ^n534 Suppose a man were to say, 
‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her that I desire!’ 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether 
she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know her name or clan? Whether she’s tall or short or medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or tawny? What village, town, or city she comes from?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, do you desire someone who you’ve never even known or seen?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’ 
^n535 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
^n536 “In the same way, 
 
 
 
 
 
^n537 doesn’t the statement of those brahmins turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, Master Gotama.” 
“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see. 
2.2. The Simile of the Ladder ^n538 Suppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to a stilt longhouse. 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, that stilt longhouse that you’re building a ladder for—do you know whether it’s to the north, south, east, or west? Or whether it’s tall or short or medium?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ 
They’d say to him, 
‘Mister, are you building a ladder for a longhouse that you’ve never even known or seen?’ 
Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’ 
^n539 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” 
^n540 “In the same way, 
 
 
 
 
^n541 doesn’t the statement of those brahmins turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” 
“Clearly that’s the case, Master Gotama.” 
“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see. 
2.3. The Simile of the River Aciravatī ^n542 Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. 
Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore. 
Standing on the near shore, they’d call out to the far shore, 
‘Come here, far shore! Come here, far shore!’ 
^n543 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Would the far shore of the Aciravatī river come over to the near shore because of that man’s call, request, desire, or expectation?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
^n544 “In the same way, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas proceed having given up those things that make one a true brahmin, and having undertaken those things that make one not a true brahmin. Yet they say: 
‘We call upon Inda! We call upon Soma! We call upon Īsāna! We call upon Pajāpati! We call upon Brahmā! We call upon Mahiddhi! We call upon Yama!’ 
So long as they proceed in this way it’s impossible that they will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā. 
^n545 Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. 
Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore. 
But while still on the near shore, their arms are tied tightly behind their back with a strong chain. 
What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Could that person cross over to the far shore?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
^n546 “In the same way, the five kinds of sensual stimulation are called ‘chains’ and ‘fetters’ in the training of the noble one. 
What five? 
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
Sounds known by the ear … 
Smells known by the nose … 
Tastes known by the tongue … 
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation that are called ‘chains’ and ‘fetters’ in the training of the noble one. 
The brahmins proficient in the three Vedas enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. 
So long as they enjoy them it’s impossible that they will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā. 
^n547 Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. 
Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore. 
But they’d lie down wrapped in cloth from head to foot. 
What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Could that person cross over to the far shore?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
^n548 “In the same way, the five hindrances are called ‘obstacles’ and ‘hindrances’ and ‘coverings’ and ‘shrouds’ in the training of the noble one. 
What five? 
The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. 
These five hindrances are called ‘obstacles’ and ‘hindrances’ and ‘coverings’ and ‘shrouds’ in the training of the noble one. 
^n549 The brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are hindered, obstructed, covered, and shrouded by these five hindrances. 
So long as they are so obstructed it’s impossible that they will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā. 
3. Converging ^n550 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Have you heard that the brahmins who are elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, say whether Brahmā is possessive or not?” 
“That he is not, Master Gotama.” 
“Is his heart full of enmity or not?” 
“It is not.” 
“Is his heart full of ill will or not?” 
“It is not.” 
“Is his heart corrupted or not?” 
“It is not.” 
“Does he wield power or not?” 
“He does.” 
“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas possessive or not?” 
“They are.” 
“Are their hearts full of enmity or not?” 
“They are.” 
“Are their hearts full of ill will or not?” 
“They are.” 
“Are their hearts corrupted or not?” 
“They are.” 
“Do they wield power or not?” 
“They do not.” 
^n551 “So it seems that the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are possessive, but Brahmā is not. 
But would brahmins who are possessive come together and converge with Brahmā, who isn’t possessive?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s impossible that the brahmins who are possessive will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā, who isn’t possessive. 
And it seems that the brahmins have enmity, 
ill will, 
corruption, 
and do not wield power, while Brahmā is the opposite in all these things. But would brahmins who are opposite to Brahmā in all things come together and converge with him?” 
“No, Master Gotama.” 
“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s impossible that such brahmins will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā. 
^n552 But here the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas sink down where they have sat, only to be torn apart; all the while imagining that they’re crossing over to drier ground.
That’s why the three Vedas of the brahmins are called a ‘salted land’ and a ‘barren land’ and a ‘disaster’.” 
^n553 When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha, 
“I have heard, Master Gotama, that you know the path to company with Brahmā.” 
“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Is the village of Manasākaṭa nearby?” 
“Yes it is.” 
^n554 “What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Suppose a person was born and raised in Manasākaṭa. 
And as soon as they left the town some people asked them for the road to Manasākaṭa. 
Would they be slow or hesitant to answer?” 
“No, Master Gotama. 
Why is that? 
Because they were born and raised in Manasākaṭa. They’re well acquainted with all the roads to the village.” 
“Still, it’s possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer. But the Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the Brahmā realm or the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm. 
I understand Brahmā, the Brahmā realm, and the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm, practicing in accordance with which one is reborn in the Brahmā realm.” 
^n555 When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha, 
“I have heard, Master Gotama, that you teach the path to company with Brahmā.
Please teach us that path and elevate this generation of brahmins.” 
“Well then, Vāseṭṭha, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Vāseṭṭha. 
4. Teaching the Path to Brahmā ^n556 The Buddha said this: 
“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … 
That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … 
Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. 
They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four directions. 
In the same way, when the heart’s release by love has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there. 
This is a path to companionship with Brahmā. 
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion … 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four directions. 
In the same way, when the heart’s release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there. 
This too is a path to companionship with Brahmā. 
^n557 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
When a mendicant meditates like this, are they possessive or not?” 
“They are not.”
“Is their heart full of enmity or not?” 
“It is not.” 
“Is their heart full of ill will or not?” 
“It is not.” 
“Is their heart corrupted or not?” 
“It is not.” 
“Do they wield power or not?” 
“They do.” 
“So it seems that that mendicant is not possessive, and neither is Brahmā. 
Would a mendicant who is not possessive come together and converge with Brahmā, who isn’t possessive?” 
“Yes, Master Gotama.” 
“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s possible that a mendicant who is not possessive will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā, who isn’t possessive. 
^n558 And it seems that that mendicant has no enmity, 
ill will, 
corruption, 
and does wield power, while Brahmā is the same in all these things. Would a mendicant who is the same as Brahmā in all things come together and converge with him?” 
“Yes, Master Gotama.” 
“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s possible that that mendicant will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā.” 
^n559 When he had spoken, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to him, 
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
