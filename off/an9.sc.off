^ck#a9(Book of Nine)^ckan#a9a(1. Awakening )Awakening ^bk#an9^n1 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
“Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: 
‘Reverends, what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening factors?’ How would you answer them?” 
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. … The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 
“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: 
‘Reverends, what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening factors?’ You should answer them: 
‘It’s when a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. 
This is the first vital condition for the development of the awakening factors. 
Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
This is the second vital condition for the development of the awakening factors. 
Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. 
This is the third vital condition for the development of the awakening factors. 
Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. 
This is the fourth vital condition for the development of the awakening factors. 
Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. 
This is the fifth vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.’ 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to 
be ethical … 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to 
take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart … 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to 
live with energy roused up … 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to 
be wise … 
But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things. 
They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’. 
When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized. 
Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.” 

1. Awakening )Supported ^n2 Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Sir, they speak of being ‘supported’. 
How is a mendicant who is supported defined?” 
“Mendicant, if a mendicant supported by faith gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them. 
If a mendicant supported by conscience … 
If a mendicant supported by prudence … 
If a mendicant supported by energy … 
If a mendicant supported by wisdom gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them. 
What’s been given up is completely given up when it has been given up by seeing with noble wisdom. 
But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should rely on four things. 
What four? 
After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things. 
That’s how a mendicant is supported.” 

1. Awakening )With Meghiya ^n3 At one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain. 
Now, at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddha’s attendant. 
Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, I’d like to enter Jantu village for alms.” 
“Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.” 
Then Meghiya robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Jantu village for alms. 
After the meal, on his return from almsround in Jantu village, he went to the shore of Kimikālā river. 
As he was going for a walk along the shore of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango grove. 
It occurred to him, 
“Oh, this mango grove is lovely and delightful! It’s truly good enough for meditation for a gentleman who wants to meditate. 
If the Buddha allows me, I’ll come back to this mango grove to meditate.” 
Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding, 







“If the Buddha allows me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” 
“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.” 
For a second time Meghiya said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement. 
But I have. 
If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” 
“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.” 
For a third time Meghiya said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement. 
But I have. 
If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” 
“Meghiya, since you speak of meditation, what can I say? 
Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.” 
Then Meghiya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to that mango grove, and, having plunged deep into it, sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation. 
But while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts, namely, 
sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. 
Then he thought, 
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
I’ve gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith, 
but I’m still harassed by these three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts: 
sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.” 
Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 







“Meghiya, when the heart’s release is not ripe, five things help it ripen. 
What five? 
Firstly, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. 
This is the first thing … 
Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
This is the second thing … 
Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. 
This is the third thing … 
Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. 
This is the fourth thing … 
Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. 
This is the fifth thing that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, helps it ripen. 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to 
be ethical … 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to 
take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart … 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be energetic … 
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be wise … 
But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things. 
They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’. 
When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized. 
Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.” 

1. Awakening )With Nandaka ^n4 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. 
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end. 
When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked with the latch. 
The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha, 
and he entered the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
He said to Nandaka, 
“Nandaka, that was a long exposition of the teaching you gave to the mendicants. 
My back was aching while I stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.” 
When he said this, Nandaka felt embarrassed and said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, we didn’t know that the Buddha was standing outside the door. 
If we’d known, I wouldn’t have said so much.” 
Then the Buddha, knowing that Nandaka was embarrassed, said to him, 
“Good, good, Nandaka! 
It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together for a Dhamma talk. 
When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things: 
discuss the teachings or keep noble silence. 
Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical. 
So they’re incomplete in that respect, 
and should fulfill it, thinking, 
‘How can I become faithful and ethical?’ 
When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they’re complete in that respect. 
A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but does not get internal serenity of heart. 
So they’re incomplete in that respect, 
and should fulfill it, thinking, 
‘How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart?’ 
When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart, they’re complete in that respect. 
A mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. 
So they’re incomplete in that respect. 
Suppose, Nandaka, there was a four-footed animal 
that was lame and disabled. 
It would be incomplete in that respect. 
In the same way, a mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. 
So they’re incomplete in that respect, 
and should fulfill it, thinking, 
‘How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart and get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles?’ 
When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart and gets the higher wisdom of discernment of principles, they’re complete in that respect.” 
That is what the Buddha said. 
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 
Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Nandaka said to the mendicants, 
“Just now, reverends, the Buddha explained a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure in four statements, before getting up from his seat and entering his dwelling: 
‘Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical. 
So they’re incomplete in that respect, 
and should fulfill it, thinking, 
“How can I become faithful and ethical?” 
When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they’re complete in that respect. 
A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but does not get internal serenity of heart. … 
They get internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. 
So they’re incomplete in that respect. 
Suppose, Nandaka, there was a four-footed animal that was lame and disabled. 
It would be incomplete in that respect. 
In the same way, a mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. 
So they’re incomplete in that respect, 
and should fulfill it, thinking: 
“How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart and get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles?” 
When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart and gets the higher wisdom of discernment of principles, 
they’re complete in that respect.’ 
Reverends, there are these five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time. 
What five? 
Firstly, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
Whenever they do this, they become liked and approved by the Teacher, respected and admired. 
This is the first benefit … 
Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma … 
Whenever they do this, they feel inspired by the meaning and the teaching in that Dhamma. 
This is the second benefit … 
Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma … 
Whenever they do this, they see the meaning of a deep saying in that Dhamma with penetrating wisdom. 
This is the third benefit … 
Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma … 
Whenever they do this, their spiritual companions esteem them more highly, thinking, 
‘For sure this venerable has attained or will attain.’ 
This is the fourth benefit … 
Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma … 
Whenever they do this, there may be trainee mendicants present, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary. Hearing that teaching, they rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. 
There may be perfected mendicants present, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. Hearing that teaching, they simply live happily in the present life. 
This is the fifth benefit … 
These are the five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time.” 

1. Awakening )Powers ^n5 “Mendicants, there are these four powers. 
What four? 
The powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness. 
And what is the power of wisdom? 
One has clearly seen and clearly contemplated with wisdom those qualities that are skillful and considered to be skillful; those that are unskillful … blameworthy … blameless … dark … bright … to be cultivated … not to be cultivated … not worthy of the noble ones … worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones. 
This is called the power of wisdom. 
And what is the power of energy? 
One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to give up those qualities that are unskillful and considered to be unskillful; those that are blameworthy … dark … not to be cultivated … not worthy of the noble ones and considered to be not worthy of the noble ones. 
One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to gain those qualities that are skillful and considered to be skillful; those that are blameless … bright … to be cultivated … worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones. 
This is called the power of energy. 
And what is the power of blamelessness? 
It’s when a noble disciple has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. 
This is called the power of blamelessness. 
And what is the power of inclusiveness? 
There are these four ways of being inclusive. 
Giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality. 
The best of gifts is the gift of the teaching. 
The best sort of kindly speech is to teach the Dhamma again and again to someone who is engaged and who lends an ear. 
The best way of taking care is to encourage, settle, and ground the unfaithful in faith, the unethical in ethics, the stingy in generosity, and the ignorant in wisdom. 
The best kind of equality is the equality of a stream-enterer with another stream-enterer, a once-returner with another once-returner, a non-returner with another non-returner, and a perfected one with another perfected one. 
This is called the power of inclusiveness. 
These are the four powers. 
A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past five fears. 
What five? 
Fear regarding livelihood, disrepute, feeling insecure in an assembly, death, and bad rebirth. 
Then that noble disciple reflects: 
‘I have no fear regarding livelihood. 
Why would I be afraid of that? 
I have these four powers: 
the powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness. 
A witless person might fear for their livelihood. 
A lazy person might fear for their livelihood. 
A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might fear for their livelihood. 
A person who does not include others might fear for their livelihood. 
I have no fear of disrepute … 
I have no fear about feeling insecure in an assembly … 
I have no fear of death … 
I have no fear of a bad rebirth. 
Why would I be afraid of that? 
I have these four powers: 
the powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness. 
A witless person might be afraid of a bad rebirth. 
A lazy person might be afraid of a bad rebirth. 
A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might be afraid of a bad rebirth. 
A person who does not include others might be afraid of a bad rebirth.’ 
A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past these five fears.” 

1. Awakening )Association ^n6 There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, you should distinguish two kinds of people: 
those you should associate with, and those you shouldn’t associate with. 
You should distinguish two kinds of robes: 
those you should wear, and those you shouldn’t wear. 
You should distinguish two kinds of almsfood: 
that which you should eat, and that which you shouldn’t eat. 
You should distinguish two kinds of lodging: 
those you should frequent, and those you shouldn’t frequent.

That’s what I said, but why did I say it? 
Well, should you know of a person: 
‘When I associate with this person, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline. 
And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by. 
And the goal of the ascetic life for which I went forth from the lay life to homelessness is not being fully developed.’ In this case you should leave that person at that very time of the day or night, without asking. You shouldn’t follow them. 
Whereas, should you know of a person: 
‘When I associate with this person, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline.

However, the goal of the ascetic life for which I went forth from the lay life to homelessness is not being fully developed.’ In this case you should leave that person after reflecting, without asking. You shouldn’t follow them.

1. Awakening )With Sutavā the Wanderer ^n7 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
Then the wanderer Sutavā went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
“Sir, one time the Buddha was staying right here in Rājagaha, the Mountainfold. 
There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 
‘A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in five respects. 
A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person.’ 
I trust I properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered that from the Buddha?” 
“Indeed, Sutavā, you properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered that. 
In the past, as today, I say this: 
‘A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in nine respects. 
A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person. And they can’t make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, or cowardice.’ 
In the past, as today, I say this: 
‘A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in these nine respects.’” 

1. Awakening )With the Wanderer Sajjha ^n8 At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
Then the wanderer Sajjha went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.

1. Awakening )Persons ^n9 “Mendicants, these nine people are found in the world. 
What nine? 
The perfected one and the one practicing for perfection. The non-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The once-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of once-return. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry. And the ordinary person. 
These are the nine people found in the world.” 

1. Awakening )Worthy of Offerings Dedicated to the Gods ^n10 “Mendicants, these nine people are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world. 
What nine? 
The perfected one and the one practicing for perfection. The non-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The once-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of once-return. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry. And a member of the spiritual family. 
These are the nine people who are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world.” 







^ckan#a9b(2. The Lion’s Roar )Sāriputta’s Lion’s Roar ^n11 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
“Sir, I have completed the rainy season residence at Sāvatthī. 
I wish to depart to wander the countryside.” 
“Please, Sāriputta, go at your convenience.” 
Then Sāriputta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
And then, not long after Sāriputta had left, a certain monk said to the Buddha, 
“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.” 
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, 
“Please, monk, in my name tell Sāriputta that 
the teacher summons him.” 
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and said to him, 
“Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.” 
“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied. 
Now at that time the venerables Mahāmoggallāna and Ānanda took a key and went from dwelling to dwelling, saying: 
“Come forth, venerables! Come forth, venerables! 
Now Venerable Sāriputta will roar his lion’s roar in the presence of the Buddha!” 
Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Sāriputta, one of your spiritual companions has made this complaint: 
‘Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.’” 
“Sir, someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. 
Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this. 
In the same way, I live with a heart like the earth, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. 
Suppose they were to wash both clean and unclean things in water, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The water isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this.

In the same way, I live with a heart like fire, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.

Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. 
Suppose there was a bull with his horns cut, gentle, well tamed and well trained. He’d wander from street to street and square to square without hurting anyone with his feet or horns. 
In the same way, I live with a heart like a bull with horns cut, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. 
Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted. 
In the same way, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by this rotten body. 
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. 
Suppose someone was to carry around a bowl of fat that was leaking and oozing from holes and cracks. 
In the same way, I carry around this body that’s leaking and oozing from holes and cracks. 
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.” 
Then that monk rose from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak ill of Venerable Sāriputta with a false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim. 
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” 
“Indeed, monk, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way. 
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. 
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” 
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta, 
“Sāriputta, forgive that silly man before his head explodes into seven pieces right here.” 
“I will pardon that venerable if he asks me: 
‘May the venerable please pardon me too.’” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )With Something Left Over ^n12 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
Then it occurred to him, 
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. 
Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” 
Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. 
Now at that time while those wanderers of other religions were sitting together this discussion came up among them: 
“Reverends, no-one who dies with something left over is exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.” 
Sāriputta neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions. 
He got up from his seat, thinking, 
“I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” 
Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 











“Sāriputta, these foolish, incompetent wanderers following other religions: who are they to know whether someone has something left over or not? 
There are these nine people who, dying with something left over, are exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 
What nine? 
There’s a person who has fulfilled ethics and immersion, but has limited wisdom. 
With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished between one life and the next. 
This is the first person … 
Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics and immersion, but has limited wisdom. 
With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished upon landing. This is the second person … 
With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished without extra effort. 
This is the third person … 
With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished with extra effort. 
This is the fourth person … 
With the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to the Akaniṭṭha realm. 
This is the fifth person … 
Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited immersion and wisdom. 
With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. 
This is the sixth person … 
Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited immersion and wisdom. 
With the ending of three fetters, they’re a one-seeder. They will be reborn just one time in a human existence, then make an end of suffering. 
This is the seventh person … 
Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited immersion and wisdom. 
With the ending of three fetters, they go from family to family. They will transmigrate between two or three families and then make an end of suffering. 
This is the eighth person … 
Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited immersion and wisdom. 
With the ending of three fetters, they have at most seven rebirths. They will transmigrate at most seven times among gods and humans and then make an end of suffering. 
This is the ninth person … 
These foolish, incompetent wanderers following other religions: who are they to know whether someone has something left over or not? 
These are the nine people who, dying with something left over, are exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 
Up until now, Sāriputta, I have not felt the need to give this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. 
Why is that? 
For I didn’t want those who heard it to introduce negligence. 
However, I have spoken it in order to answer your question.” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )With Koṭṭhita ^n13 Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta: 
“Reverend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced in this life be experienced by me in lives to come’?” 
“Certainly not, reverend.” 
“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced in lives to come be experienced by me in this life’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced as pleasant be experienced by me as painful’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced as painful be experienced by me as pleasant’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced when ripe be experienced by me when unripe’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced when unripe be experienced by me when ripe’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced a lot be experienced by me a little’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced a little be experienced by me a lot’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds to be experienced by me be not experienced’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: ‘May deeds not to be experienced be experienced’?” 
“Certainly not.” 
“Reverend Sāriputta, when you were asked whether the spiritual life was lived under the Buddha so that deeds to be experienced in this life are experienced in lives to come, you said, ‘Certainly not’. 
When you were asked whether the spiritual life was lived under the Buddha so that deeds to be experienced in lives to come are experienced in this life … 
deeds to be experienced as pleasant are experienced as painful … 
deeds to be experienced as painful are experienced as pleasant … 
deeds to be experienced when ripe are experienced when unripe … 
deeds to be experienced when unripe are experienced when ripe … 
deeds to be experienced a lot are experienced a little … 
deeds to be experienced a little are experienced a lot … 
deeds to be experienced are not experienced … 
When you were asked whether the spiritual life was lived under the Buddha so that deeds not to be experienced are experienced, you said, ‘Certainly not.’ 
Then what exactly is the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha?” 
“Reverend, the spiritual life is lived under the Buddha to know, see, attain, realize, and comprehend that which is unknown, unseen, unattained, unrealized, and uncomprehended.” 
“But what is the unknown, unseen, unattained, unrealized, and uncomprehended?” 
“‘This is suffering.’ … 

‘This is the origin of suffering.’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering.’ … 
‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ … 

This is the unknown, unseen, unattained, unrealized, and uncomprehended. 
The spiritual life is lived under the Buddha to know, see, attain, realize, and comprehend this.” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )With Samiddhi ^n14 Then Venerable Samiddhi went up to Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and sat to one side. Venerable Sāriputta said to him: 
“Samiddhi, based on what do thoughts arise in a person?” 
“Based on name and form, sir.” 
“Where do they become diversified?” 
“In the elements.” 
“What is their origin?” 
“Contact is their origin.” 
“What is their meeting place?” 
“Feeling is their meeting place.” 
“What is their chief?” 
“Immersion is their chief.” 
“What is their ruler?” 
“Mindfulness is their ruler.” 
“What is their overseer?” 
“Wisdom is their overseer.” 
“What is their core?” 
“Freedom is their core.” 
“What is their culmination?” 
“They culminate in the deathless.” 
“Samiddhi, when you were asked what is the basis on which thoughts arise in a person, you answered ‘name and form’. 
When you were asked … 






what is their culmination, you answered ‘the deathless’. 
Good, good, Samiddhi! 
It’s good that you answered each question. But don’t get conceited because of that.” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )The Simile of the Boil ^n15 “Mendicants, suppose there was a boil that was many years old. 
And that boil had nine orifices that were continually open wounds. 
Whatever oozed out of them 
would be filthy, stinking, and disgusting. 
Whatever leaked out them 
would be filthy, stinking, and disgusting. 
‘Boil’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. 
And that boil has nine orifices that are continually open wounds. 
Whatever oozes out of them 
is filthy, stinking, and disgusting. 
Whatever leaks out of them 
is filthy, stinking, and disgusting. 
So, mendicants, have no illusion about this body.” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )Perceptions ^n16 “Mendicants, these nine perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless. 
What nine? 
The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, not-self in suffering, giving up, and fading away. 
These nine perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless.” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )Families ^n17 “Mendicants, visiting a family with nine factors is not worthwhile, or if you’ve already arrived, sitting down is not worthwhile. 
What nine? 
They don’t politely rise, bow, or offer a seat. They hide what they have. Even when they have much they give little. Even when they have refined things they give coarse things. They give carelessly, not carefully. They don’t sit nearby to listen to the teachings. When you’re speaking, they don’t listen well. 
Visiting a family with these nine factors is not worthwhile, or if you’ve already arrived, sitting down is not worthwhile. 
Visiting a family with nine factors is worthwhile, or if you’ve already arrived, sitting down is worthwhile.

Visiting a family with these nine factors is worthwhile, or if you’ve already arrived, sitting down is worthwhile.” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )The Sabbath with Nine Factors ^n18 “Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its nine factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. 
And how should it be observed? 
It’s when a noble disciple reflects: 
‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. 
I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. 
I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ 
This is its first factor. … 
‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. 
I, too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. 
I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ 
This is its eighth factor. 
They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
This is its ninth factor. 
The observance of the sabbath with its nine factors in this way is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )A Deity ^n19 “Mendicants, tonight, several glorious deities, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me: 
‘Sir, formerly when we were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. 
We politely rose for them, but we didn’t bow. 
And so, having not fulfilled our duty, full of remorse and regret, we were reborn in a lesser realm.’ 
Then several other deities came to me and said: 
‘Sir, formerly when we were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. 
We politely rose for them and bowed, but we didn’t offer a seat. 
And so, having not fulfilled our duty, full of remorse and regret, we were reborn in a lesser realm.’ 
Then several other deities came to me and said: 
‘Sir, formerly when we were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. 
We politely rose for them, bowed, and offered a seat, but we didn’t share as best we could. …’ 
‘… we didn’t sit nearby to listen to the teachings. …’ 
‘… we didn’t lend an ear to the teachings. …’ 
‘… we didn’t memorize the teachings. …’ 
‘… we didn’t examine the meaning of teachings we’d memorized. …’ 
‘… having understood the meaning and the teaching, we didn’t practice accordingly. 
And so, having not fulfilled our duty, full of remorse and regret, we were reborn in a lesser realm.’ 
Then several other deities came to me and said: 
‘Sir, formerly when we were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. 
We politely rose, bowed, and offered them a seat. We shared as best we could. We sat nearby to listen to the teachings, lent an ear, memorized them, and examined their meaning. Understanding the teaching and the meaning we practiced accordingly. 
And so, having fulfilled our duty, free of remorse and regret, we were reborn in a superior realm.’ 
Here, mendicants, are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later, like those former deities.” 

2. The Lion’s Roar )About Velāma ^n20 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
“Householder, I wonder whether your family gives gifts?” 
“It does, sir. 
But only coarse gruel with pickles.” 
“Householder, someone might give a gift that’s either coarse or fine. 
But they give it carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with their own hand. They give the dregs, and they give without consideration for consequences. 
Then wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their mind doesn’t incline toward enjoyment of nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. 
And their children, wives, bondservants, employees, and workers don’t want to listen to them. They don’t pay attention or try to understand. 
Why is that? 
Because that is the result of deeds done carelessly. 
Someone might give a gift that’s either coarse or fine. 
And they give it carefully, thoughtfully, with their own hand. They don’t give the dregs, and they give with consideration for consequences. 
Then wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their mind inclines toward enjoyment of nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. 
And their children, wives, bondservants, employees, and workers want to listen. They pay attention and try to understand. 
Why is that? 
Because that is the result of deeds done carefully. 
Once upon a time, householder, there was a brahmin named Velāma. 
He gave the following gift, a great offering. 
84,000 gold bowls filled with silver. 84,000 silver bowls filled with gold. 84,000 bronze bowls filled with gold coins. 84,000 elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting. 84,000 chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting. 84,000 milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails. 84,000 maidens bedecked with jeweled earrings. 84,000 couches spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with canopies above and red pillows at both ends. 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. And who can say how much food, drink, snacks, meals, refreshments, and beverages? It seemed like an overflowing river. 
Householder, you might think: 
‘Surely the brahmin Velāma must have been someone else at that time?’ 
But you should not see it like this. 
I myself was the brahmin Velāma at that time. 
I gave that gift, a great offering. 
But at that event there was no-one worthy of a religious donation, and no-one to purify the religious donation. 
It would be more fruitful to feed one person accomplished in view than that great offering of Velāma. 
It would be more fruitful to feed one once-returner than a hundred persons accomplished in view. 
It would be more fruitful to feed one non-returner than a hundred once-returners. 
It would be more fruitful to feed one perfected one than a hundred non-returners. 
It would be more fruitful to feed one independent Buddha than a hundred perfected ones. 
It would be more fruitful to feed one Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha than a hundred independent Buddhas. 
It would be more fruitful to feed the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha than to feed one Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. 
It would be more fruitful to build a dwelling especially for the Saṅgha of the four quarters than to feed the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha. 
It would be more fruitful to go for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha with a confident heart than to build a dwelling for the Saṅgha of the four quarters. 
It would be more fruitful to undertake the training rules—not to kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence—than to go for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha with a confident heart. 
It would be more fruitful to develop a heart of love—even just as long as it takes to pull a cow’s udder—than to undertake the training rules. 
It would be more fruitful to develop the perception of impermanence—even for as long as a finger-snap—than to do all of these things, including developing a heart of love for as long as it takes to pull a cow’s udder.”

3. Abodes of Sentient Beings )Rooted in Craving ^n23 “Mendicants, I will teach you about nine things rooted in craving. 
And what are the nine things rooted in craving? 
Craving is a cause of seeking. Seeking is a cause of gaining material possessions. Gaining material possessions is a cause of assessing. Assessing is a cause of desire and lust. Desire and lust is a cause of attachment. Attachment is a cause of ownership. Ownership is a cause of stinginess. Stinginess is a cause of safeguarding. Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and fights, accusations, divisive speech, and lies. 
These are the nine things rooted in craving.” 

3. Abodes of Sentient Beings )Abodes of Sentient Beings ^n24 “Mendicants, there are nine abodes of sentient beings. 
What nine? 
There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in perception, such as human beings, some gods, and some beings in the underworld. 
This is the first abode of sentient beings. 
There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in perception, such as the gods reborn in Brahmā’s Host through the first absorption. 
This is the second abode of sentient beings. 
There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance. 
This is the third abode of sentient beings. 
There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in perception, such as the gods replete with glory. 
This is the fourth abode of sentient beings. 
There are sentient beings that are non-percipient and do not experience anything, such as the gods who are non-percipient beings. 
This is the fifth abode of sentient beings. 
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite space. 
This is the sixth abode of sentient beings. 
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness. 
This is the seventh abode of sentient beings. 
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they have been reborn in the dimension of nothingness. 
This is the eighth abode of sentient beings. 
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of nothingness. They have been reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. 
This is the ninth abode of sentient beings. 
These are the nine abodes of sentient beings.” 

3. Abodes of Sentient Beings )Consolidated by Wisdom ^n25 “Mendicants, when a mendicant’s mind has been well consolidated with wisdom it’s appropriate for them to say: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’ 
And how is a mendicant’s mind well consolidated with wisdom? 
The mind is well consolidated with wisdom when they know: ‘My mind is without greed.’ 
… ‘My mind is without hate.’ 
… ‘My mind is without delusion.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to become greedy.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to become hateful.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to become deluded.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the sensual realm.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the realm of luminous form.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the formless realm.’ 
When a mendicant’s mind has been well consolidated with wisdom it’s appropriate for them to say: 
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’” 

3. Abodes of Sentient Beings )The Simile of the Stone Pillar ^n26 So I have heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
There Venerable Candikāputta addressed the mendicants, 
“Reverends, Devadatta teaches the mendicants like this: 
‘When a mendicant’s mind is solidified by heart, it’s appropriate for them to say: 
“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’” 
When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to him, 
“Reverend Candikāputta, Devadatta does not teach the mendicants like that. 


He teaches like this: 
‘When a mendicant’s mind is well consolidated by heart, it’s appropriate for them to say: 
“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’” 
For a second time … 










And for a third time Venerable Candikāputta addressed the mendicants … 



And for a third time, Sāriputta said to him, 
“Reverend Candikāputta, Devadatta does not teach the mendicants like that. 


He teaches like this: 
‘When a mendicant’s mind is well consolidated by heart, it’s appropriate for them to say: 
“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’ 
And how is a mendicant’s mind well consolidated by heart? 
The mind is well consolidated by heart when they know: ‘My mind is without greed.’ 
… ‘My mind is without hate.’ 
… ‘My mind is without delusion.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to become greedy.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to become hateful.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to become deluded.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the sensual realm.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the realm of luminous form.’ 
… ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the formless realm.’ 
When a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t occupy their mind. 
The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. 
Suppose there was a stone pillar, sixteen feet long. 
Eight feet were buried underground, and eight above ground. 
And violent storms were to blow up out of the east, the west, the north, and the south. 


They couldn’t make it tremor and tremble and quake. 
Why is that? 
It’s because that stone pillar is firmly embedded, with deep foundations. 
In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t occupy their mind. 
The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. 
If even compelling sounds … 
smells … 
tastes … 
touches … 
and thoughts come into the range of the mind they don’t occupy the mind. 
The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance.” 

3. Abodes of Sentient Beings )Dangers and Threats (1st) ^n27 Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, and has the four factors of stream-entry, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 
What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? 
Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness. 
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures. 
Anyone who steals … 
Anyone who commits sexual misconduct … 
Anyone who lies … 
Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness. 
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. 
These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled. 
What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? 
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: 
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
They have experiential confidence in the teaching: 
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 
They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ 
And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. 
These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. 
When a noble disciple has quelled these five dangers and threats, and has these four factors of stream-entry, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”

3. Abodes of Sentient Beings )Grounds for Resentment ^n29 “Mendicants, there are nine grounds for resentment. 
What nine? 
Thinking: ‘They did wrong to me,’ you harbor resentment. 
Thinking: ‘They are doing wrong to me’ … 
‘They will do wrong to me’ … 
‘They did wrong to someone I love’ … 
‘They are doing wrong to someone I love’ …

3. Abodes of Sentient Beings )Progressive Cessations ^n31 “Mendicants, there are these nine progressive cessations.

For someone who has attained the first absorption, sensual perceptions have ceased. 
For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have ceased. 
For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has ceased. 
For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has ceased. 
For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite space, the perception of form has ceased.

^ckan#a9d(4. The Great Chapter )Progressive Meditations ^n32 “Mendicants, there are these nine progressive meditations.

4. The Great Chapter )The Nine Progressive Meditative Attainments ^n33 “Mendicants, I will teach you the nine progressive meditative attainments … 
And what are the nine progressive meditative attainments? 
Where sensual pleasures cease, and those who have thoroughly ended sensual pleasures meditate, I say: ‘Clearly those venerables are desireless, extinguished, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.’ 
If someone should say, ‘I do not know or see where sensual pleasures cease’, 
they should be told: 
‘Reverend, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
That’s where sensual pleasures cease.’ 
Clearly someone who is not devious or deceitful would approve and agree with that statement. 
They’d say ‘Good!’ and bowing down, they’d pay homage with joined palms. 
Where the placing of the mind and keeping it connected cease, and those who have thoroughly ended the placing of the mind and keeping it connected meditate, I say: ‘Clearly those venerables are desireless, extinguished, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.’

If someone should say, ‘I do not know or see where rapture ceases’, 
they should be told: 
‘It’s when a mendicant, with the fading away of rapture, enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss”.

4. The Great Chapter )Extinguishment is Bliss ^n34 At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
There he addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, extinguishment is bliss! 
Extinguishment is bliss!” 
When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him, 
“But Reverend Sāriputta, what’s blissful about it, since nothing is felt?” 
“The fact that nothing is felt is precisely what’s blissful about it. 
Reverend, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. 
What five? 
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
Sounds known by the ear … 
Smells known by the nose … 
Tastes known by the tongue … 
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation. 
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure. 
First, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption. 
While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset them, that’s an affliction for them. 
Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. 
In the same way, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset them, that’s an affliction for them. 
And affliction has been called suffering by the Buddha. 
That’s the way to understand how extinguishment is bliss. 
Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption.

4. The Great Chapter )The Simile of the Cow ^n35 “Mendicants, suppose there was a mountain cow who was foolish, incompetent, unskillful, and lacked common sense when roaming on rugged mountains. 
She might think, 
‘Why don’t I go somewhere I’ve never been before? I could eat grass and drink water that I’ve never tried before.’ 
She’d take a step with a fore-hoof; but before it was properly set down, she’d lift up a hind-hoof. 
She wouldn’t go somewhere she’d never been before, or eat grass and drink water that she’d never tried before. 
And she’d never return safely to the place she had started from. 

Why is that? 
Because that mountain cow was foolish, incompetent, unskillful, and lacked common sense when roaming on rugged mountains. 
In the same way, some foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant, lacking common sense, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
But they don’t cultivate, develop, and make much of that foundation; they don’t ensure it is properly stabilized. 
They think, 
‘Why don’t I, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ 
But they’re not able to enter and remain in the second absorption.

This is called a mendicant who has slipped and fallen from both sides. They’re like the mountain cow who was foolish, incompetent, unskillful, and lacking in common sense when roaming on rugged mountains. 
Suppose there was a mountain cow who was astute, competent, skillful, and used common sense when roaming on rugged mountains. 
She might think, 
‘Why don’t I go somewhere I’ve never been before? I could eat grass and drink water that I’ve never tried before.’

Without charging at the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. 
They cultivate, develop, and make much of that foundation, ensuring that it’s properly stabilized. 
They think, 
‘Why don’t I, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.’ 
Without charging at the cessation of perception and feeling, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. 
When a mendicant enters and emerges from all these attainments, their mind becomes pliable and workable. 
With a pliable and workable mind, their immersion becomes limitless and well developed. 
They become capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. 
They might wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again … controlling my body as far as the Brahmā realm.’ 
They are capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
They might wish: ‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’ 
They are capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
They might wish: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. 
May I understand mind with greed as “mind with greed”, 
and mind without greed as “mind without greed”; 
mind with hate as “mind with hate”, 
and mind without hate as “mind without hate”; 
mind with delusion as “mind with delusion”, 
and mind without delusion as “mind without delusion”; 
constricted mind … 
scattered mind … 
expansive mind … 
unexpansive mind … 
mind that is not supreme … 
mind that is supreme … 
mind immersed in samādhi … 
mind not immersed in samādhi … 
freed mind … 
and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’ 
They are capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
They might wish: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: “There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.” May I recollect my many past lives, with features and details.’ 
They’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
They might wish: ‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.’ 
They’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. 
They might wish: ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ 
They’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.” 

4. The Great Chapter )Depending on Absorption ^n36 “Mendicants, I say that the first absorption is a basis for ending the defilements. 
The second absorption is also a basis for ending the defilements. 
The third absorption is also a basis for ending the defilements. 
The fourth absorption is also a basis for ending the defilements. 
The dimension of infinite space is also a basis for ending the defilements. 
The dimension of infinite consciousness is also a basis for ending the defilements. 
The dimension of nothingness is also a basis for ending the defilements. 
The dimension of neither perception nor non-perception is also a basis for ending the defilements. 
The cessation of perception and feeling is also a basis for ending the defilements. 
‘The first absorption is a basis for ending the defilements.’ 
That’s what I said, but why did I say it? 
Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption. 
They contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self. 
They turn their mind away from those things, 
and apply it to the deathless: 
‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’ 
Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. 
If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. 
It’s like an archer or their apprentice who first practices on a straw man or a clay model. At a later time they become a long-distance shooter, a marksman, who shatters large objects. 
In the same way a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, enters and remains in the first absorption. 
They contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.

‘The fourth absorption is also a basis for ending the defilements.’ … 













‘The dimension of infinite space is also a basis for ending the defilements.’ 
That’s what I said, but why did I say it? 
Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. 
They contemplate the phenomena there—included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.

‘The dimension of nothingness is a basis for ending the defilements.’ 
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. 
And so, mendicants, penetration to enlightenment extends as far as attainments with perception. 
But the two dimensions that depend on these—
the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and the cessation of perception and feeling—are properly explained by mendicants who are skilled in these attainments and skilled in emerging from them, after they’ve entered them and emerged from them.” 

4. The Great Chapter )By Ānanda ^n37 At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
There Ānanda addressed the mendicants: 
“Reverends, mendicants!” 
“Reverend,” they replied. 
Ānanda said this: 
“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing! 
How this Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has found an opportunity amid confinement. It’s in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. 
The eye itself is actually present, and so are those sights. Yet one will not experience that sense-field. 
The ear itself is actually present, and so are those sounds. Yet one will not experience that sense-field. 
The nose itself is actually present, and so are those smells. Yet one will not experience that sense-field. 
The tongue itself is actually present, and so are those tastes. Yet one will not experience that sense-field. 
The body itself is actually present, and so are those touches. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.” 
When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to Venerable Ānanda: 
“Reverend Ānanda, is one who doesn’t experience that sense-field actually percipient or not?” 
“Reverend, one who doesn’t experience that sense-field is actually percipient, not non-percipient.” 
“But what does one who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceive?” 
“It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. 
One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way. 
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. 
One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way. 
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. 
One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way. 
Reverend, one time I was staying near Sāketa in the deer park in Añjana Wood. 
Then the nun Jaṭilagāhikā came up to me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me: 
‘Honorable Ānanda, regarding the immersion that does not lean forward or pull back, and is not held in place by forceful suppression. 
Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, one is not anxious. 
What did the Buddha say was the fruit of this immersion?’ 
When she said this, I said to her: 
‘Sister, regarding the immersion that does not lean forward or pull back, and is not held in place by forceful suppression. 
Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, one is not anxious. 
The Buddha said that the fruit of this immersion is enlightenment.’ 
One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way, too.” 

4. The Great Chapter )Brahmin Cosmologists ^n38 Then two brahmin cosmologists went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
“Master Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: 
‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’ 
He says: 
‘With infinite knowledge I know and see that the world is infinite.’ 
And the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan also claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: 
‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’ 
He says: 
‘With infinite knowledge I know and see that the world is finite.’ 
These two claim to speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?” 
“Enough, brahmins. 
Leave this aside: 
‘These two claim to speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?’ 
I will teach you the Dhamma. 
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
“Yes sir,” those brahmins replied. 
The Buddha said this: 
“Suppose there were four men standing in the four quarters. Each of them was extremely fast, with an extremely mighty stride. 
They’re as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow. 
Their stride was such that it spanned from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. 
Then the man standing in the east would say: 
‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ 
Though he’d travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—he’d die along the way, never reaching the end of the world. 
Then the man standing in the west … 
Then the man standing in the north … 
Then the man standing in the south would say: 
‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ 
Though he’d travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—he’d die along the way, never reaching the end of the world. 
Why is that? 
I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by running like this. 
But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. 
These five kinds of sensual stimulation are called the world in the training of the Noble One. 
What five? 
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
Sounds known by the ear … 
Smells known by the nose … 
Tastes known by the tongue … 
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. 
These five kinds of sensual stimulation are called the world in the training of the Noble One. 
Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. 
Others say of them: 
‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ 
And I also say this: 
‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ 
Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. 
Others say of them: 
‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ 
And I also say this: 
‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ 
Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. 
This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. 
Others say of them: 
‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ 
And I also say this: 
‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ 
Furthermore, take a mendicant who enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. … 
the dimension of nothingness … 
the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. 
This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. 
Others say of them: 
‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ 
And I also say this: 
‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ 
Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end. 
This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. And they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.” 

4. The Great Chapter )The War Between the Gods and the Demons ^n39 “Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
In that battle the demons won and the gods lost. 
Defeated, the gods fled north with the demons in pursuit. 
Then the gods thought, 
‘The demons are still in pursuit. 
Why don’t we engage them in battle a second time?’ 
And so a second battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
And for a second time the demons won and the gods lost. 
Defeated, the gods fled north with the demons in pursuit. 
Then the gods thought, 
‘The demons are still in pursuit. 
Why don’t we engage them in battle a third time?’ 
And so a third battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
And for a third time the demons won and the gods lost. 
Defeated and terrified, the gods fled right into the castle of the gods. 
When they had entered their castle, they thought, 
‘Now we’re in a secure location and the demons can’t do anything to us.’ 
The demons also thought, 
‘Now the gods are in a secure location and we can’t do anything to them.’ 
Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. 
Defeated, the demons fled south with the gods in pursuit. 
Then the demons thought, 
‘The gods are still in pursuit. 
Why don’t we engage them in battle a second time?’ 
And so a second battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
And for a second time the gods won and the demons lost. 
Defeated, the demons fled south with the gods in pursuit. 
Then the demons thought, 
‘The gods are still in pursuit. 
Why don’t we engage them in battle a third time?’ 
And so a third battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
And for a third time the gods won and the demons lost. 
Defeated and terrified, the demons fled right into the citadel of the demons. 
When they had entered their citadel, they thought, 
‘Now we’re in a secure location and the gods can’t do anything to us.’ 
And the gods also thought, 
‘Now the demons are in a secure location and we can’t do anything to them.’ 
In the same way, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
At such a time the mendicant thinks, 
‘Now I’m in a secure location and Māra can’t do anything to me.’ 
And Māra the Wicked also thinks, 
‘Now the mendicant is in a secure location and we can’t do anything to them.’ 
When, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
At such a time the mendicant thinks, 
‘Now I’m in a secure location and Māra can’t do anything to me.’ 
And Māra the Wicked also thinks, 
‘Now the mendicant is in a secure location and we can’t do anything to them.’ 
A mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. 
At such a time they are called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see. 
A mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. … 
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. … 
Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. … 
Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end. 
At such a time they are called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see. And they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.” 

4. The Great Chapter )The Simile of the Bull Elephant in the Forest ^n40 “Mendicants, when a wild bull elephant is engrossed in the pasture, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—got there first and trampled the grass, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. 
When the wild bull elephant is engrossed in the pasture, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—eat the broken branches that he has dragged down, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. 
When a wild bull elephant has plunged into the pool, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—got there first and stirred up the water with their trunks, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. 
When a wild bull elephant has come out of the pool and the female elephants bump into him, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. 
At that time the wild bull elephant thinks: 
‘These days I live crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. 
I eat the grass they’ve trampled, and they eat the broken branches I’ve dragged down. I drink muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bump into me. 
Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the herd?’ 
After some time he lives alone, withdrawn from the herd, and he eats untrampled grass, and other elephants don’t eat the broken branches he has dragged down. He doesn’t drink muddy water, and the female elephants don’t bump into him after his bath. 
At that time the wild bull elephant thinks: 
‘Formerly I lived crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches I’d dragged down. I drank muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bumped into me. Now I live alone, and I’m free of all these things.’ He breaks off a branch and scratches his body, happily relieving his itches. 
In the same way, when a mendicant lives crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and by monastics of other religions and their disciples, they think: 
‘These days I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. 
Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the group?’ 
They frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. 
Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, they sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in front of them. 
Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. 
Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. 
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind free of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. 
Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. 
Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. 
They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. 
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
They happily relieve their itches. 
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … 
third absorption … 
fourth absorption. 
They happily relieve their itches. 
Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. 
They happily relieve their itches. 
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. … 
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. … 
Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. … 
Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end. 
They happily relieve their itches.” 

4. The Great Chapter )With the Householder Tapussa ^n41 At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Uruvelakappa. 
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Uruvelakappa for alms. 
Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, 
“Ānanda, you stay right here, while I plunge deep into the Great Wood for the day’s meditation.” 
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. 
Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
The householder Tapussa went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
“Honorable Ānanda, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures. We like sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them. 
But renunciation seems like an abyss. 
I have heard that in this teaching and training there are very young mendicants whose minds are eager for renunciation; they’re confident, settled, and decided about it. They see it as peaceful. 
Renunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and the mendicants in this teaching and training.” 
“Householder, we should see the Buddha about this matter. 
Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this. 
As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Tapussa. 
Then Ānanda together with Tapussa went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Ānanda told him what had happened. 




“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! 
Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought, 
‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’ 
But my mind wasn’t eager for renunciation; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful. 
Then I thought, 
‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’ 
Then I thought, 
‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of renunciation, and so I haven’t developed that. 
That’s why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’ 
Then I thought, 
‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of renunciation, I were to develop that. 
It’s possible that my mind would be eager for renunciation; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’ 
And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of renunciation and developed that. 
Then my mind was eager for renunciation; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful. 
And so, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me, and that was an affliction for me. 
Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them.
